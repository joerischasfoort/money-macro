1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
2022 has been quite a year and actually

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,440
a lot of things sort of slipped my mind

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,840
so when I was doing my research I

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,460
figured let's go and review 2022

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,259
together

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,480
in the following way

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,779
so I just wanted to go over with all of

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,840
you my top stories of 2022 so these are

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,920
mainly the ones that I I covered and

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,580
then also have a look at some indicators

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,239
of what the economy actually did in 2022

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,180
so that is real GDP so adjusted for

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,300
inflation did we have a good year yes or

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,280
no inflation

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,059
we had a terrible year pretty clear

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,280
than unemployment so these three are the

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,800
main variables typically used by

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,219
macroeconomists but then because it's

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,960
money and macro uh also some

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,300
attention for financial markets which

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,980
are you know let's just spoil it also

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,079
terrible this year

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,300
and then finally I thought you know

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,820
here's some time for a q a at the end

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,939
and uh

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,760
yes that's it and with between all of

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,439
these steps I I thought Let's uh review

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,159
let's do this together so let's review

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,780
it together so I want to give a score at

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,820
least for the economic indicator so how

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,979
let this is a review right so I want to

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,500
give it a score and then I'm going to

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,780
ask all of you and if I forget let me

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,479
know in the chat to say if that's

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,920
roughly a good score higher or lower and

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,920
also I'm going to be looking at what you

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
are all saying to get sort of a feel for

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,180
the room so we're going to do the review

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,579
together so it won't just be me though I

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,220
will try to sway your opinion heavily in

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,799
my in my favor

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,900
so let's uh let's do that how does it

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,119
sound so let me just see what people are

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,399
saying

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,460
thank you for this and nice sweater by

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,040
Louis uh thank you I figured this is a

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,360
sort of a end of year Christmas type of

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,100
thing so you need to wear a Christmas

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,860
sweater

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,719
uh housing is nuts in Canada is it still

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,399
not in Canada because all over the world

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,319
it seems to be slowing down but I mean

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,720
Canada I know I have some uh some

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,580
Canadians in my patreon uh server to

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,860
whom I talk regularly and they also keep

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,920
going on and on about it and also I've

57
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,020
read this IMF report that sort of with a

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,640
slowing housing market Canada New

59
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,220
Zealand Australia these countries that

60
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,080
never had housing bust properly uh are

61
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,580
really really at risk so let's let's

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,580
we'll definitely talk about that I think

63
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,940
all right

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,580
current situation in China you know

65
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,940
we're definitely going to talk about

66
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,180
China as as well

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,160
uh yes let me let's talk about it uh

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,180
there it didn't collapse let's put it

69
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,519
like that

70
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,080
um anyhow

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
okay let's get started

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
so

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,180
top stories of 2022 so I went looking

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,540
back to what was I working on start of

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,980
the Year 2022

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,720
um and actually there was this huge

77
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,040
video on inflation

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,840
which in which uh I backed a very

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,940
controversial team that is at the time

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,040
there was a debate is inflation going to

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,659
be transitory so is it is it you know is

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,220
it going to be like a little bump and

83
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,319
has it already peaked

84
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,400
kind of thing uh or is it going to be

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
permanent

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,780
now I in I made this massive video I

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,940
released it in uh around the start of

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,440
January discussing all the arguments

89
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,420
that I that I could find from the

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,060
biggest proponents of both teams team

91
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,340
permanent saying uh represented by

92
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,379
people like Peter Schiff who said you

93
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,480
know uh money printing did all of this

94
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,540
we're going to see huge inflation and

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,879
gold is going to Skyrocket instead

96
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,920
then there was Jens weitman from the

97
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,159
Deutsche Central Bank German Central

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,379
Bank saying hey actually uh the Green

99
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,780
Revolution Energy prices are going to

100
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,900
put uh pressure on inflation from here

101
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,500
on out then we had

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,299
um Mr uh what was his name again uh uh

103
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,580
the American treasury secretary X

104
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,640
treasury secretary Larry Summers who

105
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,159
said uh is labor markets are way too hot

106
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,299
we're going to see way more inflation

107
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,880
for longer and then on the other side

108
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,639
there were more Central Bankers Joseph

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,019
stiglitz saying you know we can see some

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,120
more inflation but it's going to come

111
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,780
down uh some of it came from fiscal

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,940
stimulus uh lagar Christine lagar head

113
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,380
of the ECB saying no no it's really

114
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,600
going to be transitory

115
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,820
uh and I made this massive one hour

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,919
video and uh I made it actually already

117
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,620
in at the end of November so it was

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,840
already outdated uh when I release it

119
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,479
with unlearning economics and we backed

120
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,840
we said okay team transitory has the

121
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,120
best arguments in our opinion and uh

122
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,419
with a condition that the pandemic is

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
actually over so this was end of

124
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:59,000
November

125
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,520
2021 and that is right before Delta

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,520
became prominent in our minds that is so

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,820
that condition was obviously uh for you

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,720
know broken but that being said I got a

129
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,280
lot of lack for this uh yeah justifiably

130
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,960
I was one of the economists that didn't

131
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,880
that thought you're gonna inflation

132
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,100
around this time last year had already

133
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,000
peaked it clearly hadn't

134
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,740
what happens uh well the next subject I

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,020
I would say

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,600
because some of the other uh the other

137
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,460
teams if you notice team members were

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,160
also quite wrong right like Peter Schiff

139
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,020
said oh it's money printing but then two

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,780
things happened that really undermined

141
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,660
that hypothesis or at least made it

142
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,639
weaker uh one being that the country

143
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,780
that printed the most money the United

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,360
States

145
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,520
ended up having uh the strongest

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,560
currency the dollar and also less

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,259
inflation in Europe where they did far

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,979
less of that and then second of course

149
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:02,580
you had the invasion of Ukraine by

150
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,800
Russia and it as it turned out Putin had

151
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,300
already turned off the gas supply to a

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,600
certain extent to Europe and that

153
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,979
reverberated already to to many markets

154
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,460
and this is one of our primary inputs

155
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:17,280
our house here also runs on gas

156
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,080
um and nobody saw that coming uh it at

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
least not that I reviewed but let me

158
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,340
know in the chat if you know anyone who

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,860
said uh well there must be must have

160
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,080
been someone but I think this is just

161
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,759
um a great lesson in the sense that as a

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,419
macroeconomist you can make these

163
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,759
predictions but you are you're dependent

164
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,460
on so many factors including the the

165
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,620
whims of individual people so apparently

166
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,560
the put in I'm not sure how many people

167
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,220
he consulted for this decision

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,979
but

169
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,600
yeah as of as the if you want to be the

170
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,419
best macro economic forecaster you

171
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,520
should also be able to to forecast what

172
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,740
individuals that are super influential

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,300
like the chairman of the FED may be

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,100
somewhat easier to do because they say

175
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,400
what they're going to do but also these

176
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,660
uh world leaders like she if if she is

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,699
going to stimulate the economy like

178
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,979
crazy China's economy is not going to

179
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:11,520
collapse if Russia invades Ukraine

180
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,400
there's going to be a huge extra bout of

181
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,819
energy inflation

182
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,360
which happened so uh that's my excuse

183
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,960
judge me if you please in the chat if

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,240
you find that a fair or not excuse

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,220
for for being wrong for backing between

186
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,880
team twin story there

187
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,699
um what what do you think it will do now

188
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
yeah let's hope that it has actually

189
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,539
peaked now but again now much more

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,340
careful because it again depends on what

191
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,819
what happens with energy situation which

192
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,500
is super difficult to to oversee

193
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,560
um so that leads us to the next big

194
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,720
story uh I think the economic War

195
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,699
uh oh but wait let's first see what

196
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,160
people thought about about inflation

197
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,120
from getting roasted or what do you

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,060
think

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,319
Brad says Putin is the only Economist

200
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,340
suicide coming

201
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,340
exactly yeah

202
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,500
so Jeff your dollars seemed to be the

203
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,060
close analysis uh Navy is saying which

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,860
is a reference to this interview I did

205
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,860
with uh Jeff Schneider go check it out

206
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,840
uh on under the live tab on this channel

207
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,240
if you haven't watched it very in-depth

208
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,819
uh although I don't know if he sort of

209
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,979
predicted this kind of inflation one

210
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,979
year ago but that's a good good to check

211
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,979
um

212
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,159
the money supply expands with loans are

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,740
created yeah exactly so uh the money is

214
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,240
what Julia is saying so it's not

215
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,339
directly under control of the Central

216
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,839
Bank something that's often forgotten

217
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,920
and that I tried to feature in many of

218
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,660
my videos uh David says here in Sweden

219
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,700
house prices are pretty insane even

220
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,440
after price has gone down about seven or

221
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,180
eight percent they're still super highs

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,220
which you're saying I guess and I

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,500
totally agree

224
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,660
um I moved from Netherlands to Belgium

225
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,640
at the start of last year and in the

226
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,220
Netherlands house prices were also

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,060
extremely crazy in bedroom luckily for

228
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,060
me a bit less so

229
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,140
uh medicine is greater for the Moroccan

230
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,060
economy all right that is interesting as

231
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,720
well I should take a look at that

232
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,240
um

233
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Joseph says uh transfer was the correct

234
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,640
voice in January

235
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,200
yeah yeah that was my opinion

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,820
always happy to to hear that of course

237
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,260
but of course also feel free to

238
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,100
criticize me

239
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,779
um

240
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,640
yeah so that that was the inflation

241
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:36,480
story and it kept going throughout the

242
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,220
year uh it get got way crazy right so I

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,980
look back at the numbers it started with

244
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,800
something like five percent in the USA

245
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,000
for three four percent Europe and now

246
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,560
it's 10 Europe 8 USA and in some

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,940
countries way crazy but we're gonna talk

248
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,000
about this when we're reviewing the

249
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,640
whole Global inflation situation

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,700
economic War so they're also looking

251
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,800
back I made a video

252
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,260
um that was very controversial uh about

253
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,019
Putin's War test so there I made the

254
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,339
case I said at the time it wasn't clear

255
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,320
that they were actually going to invade

256
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,860
but they were threatening to invade and

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,100
I said you know uh Putin has amassed has

258
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,920
learned from the the war in 2014 and uh

259
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,080
or the invasion in 2014 of the Crimean

260
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,000
peninsula where they got sanctioned and

261
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,940
they have a massive huge War test of

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,440
foreign reserves so that's foreign money

263
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,560
and I said you know you can sanction

264
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,839
them but this is gonna make them immune

265
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,839
uh to to sanctions which was a bit

266
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,080
hyperbolic I have to admit so I let it

267
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,300
change it to shielded against sanctions

268
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,399
because of this huge Reserve War test

269
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,720
and this video was very interesting

270
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,000
because it aged at first really uh badly

271
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,620
and then uh really well in the sense

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,320
that the title

273
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,839
you know uh they're immune to to

274
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,519
sanctions well first the ruble

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,100
absolutely collapsed

276
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,300
um why because you know I think European

277
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,339
and U.S policy makers had also read the

278
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,820
same sort of economic sources that I do

279
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,440
and saw hey Putin has this huge War test

280
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,480
of foreign reserves if we're going to

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,959
sanction the financial sector then he

282
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,220
can say use this to save the banks and

283
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,200
its currency is not going to collapse

284
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,480
because it could just sell these

285
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,579
reserves into the market so that's

286
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,380
selling foreign currency to buy your own

287
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,779
meaning that it won't collapse right

288
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,519
you're buying your own currency back so

289
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,220
they froze the reserves which was

290
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,279
absolutely unheard of absolutely crazy

291
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,500
move uh set like I'm not no legal

292
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,420
scholar but it said a huge huge

293
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,640
precedent in my opinion but uh then uh

294
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,140
put in sort of count countered somewhat

295
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,120
in the sense that he introduced Capital

296
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,640
control so then he was

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,579
where the government uh was saying okay

298
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,660
we're going to keep them uh keep foreign

299
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,820
currency in the country we're going to

300
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,339
really restrict how much money can get

301
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,800
out and that had a huge effect then

302
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,839
stabilizing the ruble at first and then

303
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,300
it went up back again

304
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,760
uh because they have had this huge

305
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,980
current account Surplus meaning Trade

306
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Surplus meaning selling lots of oil and

307
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,560
gas for which the price was now higher

308
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,720
uh and so they made more money than ever

309
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,700
which was also uh one of my videos but

310
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,040
and that's only referring to foreign

311
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,800
currency foreign money

312
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,140
uh and so then I made this video like

313
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,440
who's actually winning and at the time

314
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,620
there was huge inflation in Russia

315
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,839
so I gave it to the west but after that

316
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,519
um massive energy inflation especially

317
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,500
in Europe but also in many more

318
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,519
countries contributing to Sky High

319
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,620
inflation

320
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,760
Russian inflation went down quite a bit

321
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,040
more but still really high and then

322
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
the Russian economy also stabilized but

323
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,320
still

324
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,839
and we're going to look at this a little

325
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,639
bit later as well am I looking at GDP

326
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,160
their economy shrank real GDP by four

327
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,260
percent whereas Western economies or

328
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,540
Allied economies I should say because

329
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,579
Japan and South Korea Singapore also

330
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,300
sanctioned

331
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:16,440
grew quite a bit more even sort of

332
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,420
accounting for inflation so I think that

333
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,500
analysis as

334
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:25,380
still still stands but you know this was

335
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,040
super painful for all sides huge

336
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:32,339
Economic Development right after a huge

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,139
pandemic so yeah

338
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:39,860
I can understand uh why

339
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:42,540
these videos were so popular and also

340
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,860
why people are voting that this was

341
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,860
actually a really bad economic year

342
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:52,320
um final lesson I would say from the

343
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,300
sanctions is that the the Imp the export

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,180
import sanctions of real Goods seem to

345
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,060
be hurting way more than the ex

346
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,480
Financial sanctions so remember uh back

347
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,519
in March oh all the Russian banks are

348
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,339
going to be cut off Swift that was all

349
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,180
over the news

350
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:15,000
seemingly didn't do so much right but

351
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:18,060
you saw all of these tanks and airplanes

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,180
or airplanes flying with a cheap

353
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,760
consumer grade GPS's

354
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,920
and all inside of that was all sort of

355
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,720
Western Equipment uh

356
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,240
I've also read quite a few reports at

357
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,639
industry in Russia is struggling they've

358
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,360
really scaled back to much more inferior

359
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,240
technology so that export sanctions seem

360
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,000
to be the ones doing the damage whereas

361
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,899
the financial sanctions

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,459
seem not to be so impactful against a

363
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,920
current account Surplus country which is

364
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,420
Russia which gets its foreign currency

365
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,500
which gets so much foreign currency that

366
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,079
it can

367
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,540
save its own financial sector I would

368
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,399
say that that would be lesson for me but

369
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm wondering what uh what do you think

370
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,060
about this

371
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,800
and I want to do an update on all of

372
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,500
this early next year maybe I figured

373
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,880
maybe it could be nice or good idea to

374
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,880
do this one year after or so

375
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:20,220
let me see what people are saying uh

376
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,320
um just economy going is not enough

377
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,880
what what do you think about the economy

378
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,620
that Terrors on goods from China are

379
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,620
contributing to inflation

380
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,500
um yeah probably they are

381
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,620
but I'm not uh I'm not entirely sure if

382
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,779
if this is a super big factor at the

383
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,220
moment because energy is is just such a

384
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,480
big factor at the moment

385
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,699
all right then let's move on so that was

386
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,639
in my opinion second base story but also

387
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:50,880
let me know if you think uh there are

388
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:54,600
big stories that I'm I'm forgetting

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,120
China slow down uh this was already

390
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,399
at the end of 2021 a story ever Grande

391
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,980
is going out of business yes or no

392
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,060
property sector slowing down you have

393
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,740
this huge huge ghost cities cities that

394
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,600
have been built and nobody's living in

395
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,279
them at some point there were reports

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
yeah but they're gonna move in there and

397
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,300
and seemingly

398
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,639
uh to some cities you know this actually

399
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,459
happened but then others not it's quite

400
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,199
difficult to get information

401
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,060
accurate information from inside China

402
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,000
about this I would say

403
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,399
but uh I think most economists agreed

404
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,180
that the property bubble was so so

405
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,860
insane in China given that they had

406
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,940
property prices on Western levels

407
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,459
whereas

408
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,860
incomes are not on those levels right so

409
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,380
that's hugely expensive relative to

410
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,060
income property I know some some of you

411
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,139
talk about it property bubble in Canada

412
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,540
but

413
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:51,240
the Chinese property bubble is

414
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,000
or was super big but then the government

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,820
itself tried to deflate it so they tried

416
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,720
to tighten the screws make the rules

417
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,300
tougher for credit flowing to to these

418
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,799
uh to these developers that were making

419
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,059
so many properties that nobody was

420
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,100
seemingly living in and yeah so I think

421
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,079
economists have been saying for a super

422
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,839
long time now or many and many investors

423
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,780
as well that China's economy is due for

424
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,880
a reckoning their debt to GDP is rising

425
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,799
because they're spending or making

426
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,299
creating all of this credit to do

427
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,459
something that's not really contributing

428
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,500
to GDP as much it is of course

429
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,380
contributing to GDP

430
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:36,299
the property sector is a profit is has

431
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:38,580
been estimated to be 27 of of um

432
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,020
of the economy in China because of

433
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,820
course construction workers are still

434
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,440
working they're still buying food

435
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,080
they're they're still buying materials

436
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,820
that it that does contribute to GDP and

437
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,299
that is roughly

438
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,820
hasn't been seen that that often before

439
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,760
only in Spain right before 2008 and

440
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,820
Spain had this huge property bubble so

441
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,640
this is why I think the most reputable

442
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,679
Economist on China that I follow have

443
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,360
been comparing it to Japan which also

444
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,640
had this huge property bubble right

445
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,640
before uh its economy completely

446
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,039
stagnated and therefore I made a call I

447
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,880
like this is probably going to stagnate

448
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,460
then of course back in 2021 at start

449
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,380
they were the big coveted winners they

450
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,900
did the serial covet policy was

451
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,039
seemingly very successful not that many

452
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,520
cases

453
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,380
but now uh or during 2022 that

454
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,900
completely changed

455
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,700
and the economy really started to hurt

456
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,000
because they had to lock down so many

457
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,419
times with Omicron variant which is much

458
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,460
more transmissible uh and so this I

459
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:48,299
think is when many many people became

460
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:52,320
super in investment terms I would say uh

461
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:54,840
bearish negative about China and for me

462
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,740
this sort of really sort of culminated

463
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,460
in YouTube videos uh proclaiming the

464
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,160
collapse of China in 30 days uh and this

465
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,559
was it when was it September so uh that

466
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,480
didn't happen and these these videos got

467
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,539
millions of views super popular and

468
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,640
they're just annoyed annoyed me because

469
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:16,980
yeah come on uh

470
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,260
but so I made the response video anyway

471
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,840
that's the that's the thumbnail that you

472
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,140
see there and I think uh there I argued

473
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,880
no yes it's a big problem but they they

474
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,320
have their own currency they like Russia

475
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
current account Surplus country so

476
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,880
they're not so they have some wiggle

477
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,460
room it's not always good to have a

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,380
current account Surplus but it gives you

479
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,620
in these situations some wiggle room

480
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,780
because you you're not at risk of

481
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,220
running out of foreign currency your own

482
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,380
currency you can always create but

483
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,200
you're not running at a risk it's really

484
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,400
risky like Sri Lanka had to run out of

485
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,620
foreign currency and then your own

486
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,679
currency collapses and then you get

487
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,539
massive inflation so uh that was my

488
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,419
argument and I think that actually held

489
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,400
up fairly well and I also said you know

490
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,039
they're going to slow down a lot and

491
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,900
seemingly that that's now also the case

492
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:13,320
but they've now abandoned their covet 19

493
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,820
uh zero lockdowns strategy and so we

494
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,039
might see somewhat of a Resurgence

495
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,679
although the

496
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,679
property sector bubble could definitely

497
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,840
be a huge downward force that that may

498
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,720
be much bigger but it's very difficult

499
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,640
to to actually say

500
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,520
but that being said this story

501
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,559
definitely dominated 2021 I would say

502
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,419
also because it meant for all sorts of

503
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,580
other countries to whom China was

504
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,340
Landing a lot especially in the Belton

505
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,720
Road initiative in the Asian countries

506
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,900
around China

507
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,000
that this money was now you know not

508
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,280
flowing anymore so quickly so

509
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,220
and this contributed arguably to some

510
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,280
other crises like we saw in Pakistan and

511
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,679
Sri Lanka

512
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,240
on top of of course the economic War so

513
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,919
on top of that all of these countries

514
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,679
had to deal with Sky High Energy prices

515
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,900
Sky High food prices and now also with

516
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,299
less investment from China less demand

517
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,900
from China for raw materials which

518
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,860
plummeted in price so huge story I would

519
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,620
say

520
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,140
I wonder what what you all think about

521
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,460
this the China story I don't think we've

522
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,539
seen the last of it

523
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,539
what do you think

524
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,380
Mr Wolf has an opinion about

525
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,220
Norway uh

526
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,220
we'll get to that

527
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,460
I don't say too much internet yet let's

528
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,860
see

529
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,740
let's see all right let's move on then

530
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,740
to what in my opinion is uh

531
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:48,480
Sri Lanka they oh okay okay this is good

532
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,340
uh CC says Sri Lanka they owe the most

533
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,860
adapt to the west and that's true right

534
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,419
even though a lot of the deaths from

535
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,360
China were hidden

536
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,520
they still owe most depth to to wet the

537
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,580
West right and this is why in my Sri

538
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,559
Lanka video I said okay there's multiple

539
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,500
factors I made sort of a game out of it

540
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,720
like who who's the worst but

541
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,240
that's YouTube has to be a bit

542
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,100
entertaining uh but uh even though it's

543
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
a very serious situation

544
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,140
but of course

545
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,620
yes you can borrow most from someone but

546
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,000
if one source of borrowing dries up

547
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,860
you're still going to be in a lot of

548
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,900
trouble right so it doesn't matter too

549
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,179
much that and I'm not blaming China for

550
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,919
this right it's like China's economy is

551
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,559
slowing down they don't want to do that

552
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,900
and so this is why a lot of that their

553
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,200
loans are now also drying up and and

554
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,820
this hurts a lot of economies but I

555
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,740
don't think you can blame the vat on

556
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,600
China you could you could blame on them

557
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,179
that they have been lending to the wrong

558
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,919
project that they have been lending to

559
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,480
corrupt projects and therefore it

560
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,220
doesn't contribute to an economy

561
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,059
building up therefore they cannot repay

562
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,700
it

563
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,100
but you cannot really blame them for

564
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,360
having a slowing economy and then not

565
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,360
being able to land so much right

566
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,210
all right uh China's too complicated for

567
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,039
my brain yes

568
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,740
[Music]

569
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,260
that's that's true uh yeah I'm gonna

570
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,720
dive into it a little bit more in 2023

571
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,059
how many more defaults do you do you see

572
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,340
in the third world many more uh in fact

573
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,760
Ghana just the defaulted

574
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,860
and they uh they apparently did it

575
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,780
prematurely so they didn't have to is

576
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,200
the the last thing that I

577
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,600
read about it but um you know this storm

578
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,380
that Sri Lanka was in which was the next

579
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,620
uh great story uh on my on my slides uh

580
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:47,520
is it's the same for everyone and

581
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,679
especially so this is I think the

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,919
the the next stories let's go to the

583
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,900
currency crisis and what I found is

584
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,720
particularly noteworthy is that there

585
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,539
there is this pattern of current account

586
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,460
deficit countries so trade deficit

587
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:05,220
countries getting into trouble notably

588
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Sri Lanka but then there's also uh

589
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,159
Tunisia uh who hasn't defaulted yet but

590
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,100
was was getting in trouble uh Haiti is

591
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,200
terrible at the moment as it has huge um

592
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,460
as a huge crisis it's not being covered

593
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,980
so much

594
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,440
at the moment but it's on my radar and

595
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,960
many countries in Africa Ghana is now

596
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,700
the the one most in the news

597
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,280
but I think there are many countries

598
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,900
that are really in a in a tricky

599
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,240
situation Pakistan is another big one

600
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,220
that I didn't get to cover but and then

601
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
they also had huge floods but all of

602
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,740
these countries you see all major

603
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,580
Emerging Markets

604
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:46,200
are or maybe maybe most economies have a

605
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,240
lot of problems at the moment but the

606
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,580
ones with the the biggest current

607
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,159
account deficits seem to get into the

608
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,960
most trouble simply because their

609
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,700
currencies then started collapsing

610
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,740
because there's not enough demand for

611
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,780
them because they're importing way more

612
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,780
needing to pay their own currency

613
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,320
um and then you get way more inflation

614
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,640
right and so you're basically running

615
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,460
out of foreign money and you cannot

616
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,220
import the stuff that you really need

617
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,580
like fuel what you saw in Sri Lanka as

618
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,320
well these huge queues for for gas and

619
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,000
these are the countries that have had a

620
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,840
really tough time and economists call

621
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,940
this

622
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,260
phenomena that you have this huge

623
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,760
difference between current account

624
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,720
Surplus and current account deficit

625
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,640
countries

626
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,919
Global imbalances is what they call this

627
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,200
and and these are and this was a really

628
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,360
hot topic right before the global

629
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,000
financial crisis

630
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,860
um where the oil exporters were having

631
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,640
these huge current gun surpluses and

632
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,360
China

633
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,860
but this lesson a little bit and now

634
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,059
it's totally back and you you're going

635
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,440
to see this as well we're going to talk

636
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:54,720
about inflation Growth Oil exporters

637
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,400
um you know are on top of the world

638
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,039
and the ones that who had this chronic

639
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,860
on deficit are really struggling and one

640
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,340
of them notably has been the UK the UK

641
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,080
uh it's one of the identical further

642
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,059
from the currency crisis this is the one

643
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,880
I covered I didn't cover I was just

644
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,980
working on other videos but there they

645
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,260
were this is not a coincidence they had

646
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,080
a nine or eight percent current account

647
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,179
deficit and the pound crashed when the

648
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,440
government announced look we're gonna do

649
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,200
this tax because

650
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,080
for wealthy people that

651
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,320
import a lot of stuff

652
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,320
so yeah

653
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,960
all right currency crisis we haven't

654
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,640
seen the last of it but I'm definitely

655
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,919
going to cover that more next year as

656
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,000
well sadly because this is not not a

657
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,900
happy thing

658
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,610
um

659
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,500
let's see some of the comments

660
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,200
[Music]

661
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,100
the bank of Japan a new

662
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,860
um

663
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,740
new curve control uh I I still have to

664
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,320
read up on it a bit more carefully

665
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,960
for commenting on that could Saudi

666
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,539
Arabia abandon the U.S dollar system so

667
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,740
this is what summer militia

668
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,419
what a name uh says yes they well

669
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,400
It's tricky because the dollar is just

670
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,320
so dominant that's also really useful

671
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,120
for Saudi Arabia because I I think they

672
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,159
buy also their stuff typically mostly

673
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,960
with the US dollar but they have been

674
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,320
talking to China to

675
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,659
start trading in huon as well and one

676
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,179
thing that we have been seeing perhaps

677
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:27,539
is at least a strong will of countries

678
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:30,620
like China Russia and their allies to

679
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:34,260
move away from the dollar system but

680
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:36,600
yeah it's really difficult but if you

681
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,279
know let's let's put it like this if you

682
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,900
want to do that if you want to move away

683
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,120
from the dollar system

684
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,640
which does allow the United States to

685
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,279
run a super high current account deficit

686
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,779
then Saudi Arabia has a good country to

687
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,220
get on your side especially now with

688
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,120
these high oil prices

689
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:56,039
so that's what I would would say to that

690
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,559
am I parsing the chapters too fast uh

691
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,860
cuckoo I'm sorry I will try to slow down

692
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,419
a little bit but there's so much more

693
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,380
uh

694
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,860
yeah

695
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,900
all right let's continue currency crisis

696
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,400
uh because all of this so I just wanted

697
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,740
to give you an overview of the biggest

698
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,600
stories in my opinion of 2021 for the

699
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,120
global economy all of this is going to

700
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,580
come back when we talk about GDP

701
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,740
inflation and unemployment again and

702
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:26,700
then there's also a q a at the end so

703
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,400
don't worry uh I'll Stick Around

704
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,480
next biggest story in my opinion cost of

705
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,320
living crisis so uh this also I would

706
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,260
say

707
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,380
why you have this difference between

708
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:44,460
pretty high GDP growth numbers

709
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,260
so and yet and and low unemployment

710
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,240
which we're also going to come to

711
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,120
and yet

712
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,320
the people feel as if we're already in

713
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,860
the recession as if the times are

714
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,260
already really bad why because for most

715
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,400
working people I would say who have a

716
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,640
steady job

717
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,919
the cost of living has really gone up so

718
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,620
their salary is not keeping up with

719
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,360
their main costs which are energy and I

720
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,400
can confirm that our Energy bill has

721
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,559
absolutely gone through the roof we had

722
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,020
to be much more careful with our energy

723
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,360
usage which is maybe the bright side

724
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,740
but also food prices

725
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,140
um and and that's

726
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,580
and that's even more terrible for the

727
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,460
people who can afford at least because

728
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,020
you know you need you need some element

729
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,600
of energy

730
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,679
you need at least food and food is a

731
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,899
bigger part of your expenses if you're

732
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,419
for most poor people typically like the

733
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,940
how the rich you are typically the more

734
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,940
relatively you spend on other stuff so

735
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,820
so if food prices go through the roof

736
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,980
yeah it really hurts you the less you

737
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,580
have and this it hurts most people and

738
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:57,539
that's I think is why so many of you

739
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,980
voted uh 2022 was a good year for the

740
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:03,299
macroeconomy

741
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,340
no it was not 82 says it was not a good

742
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,000
year

743
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,059
so yeah

744
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,580
that uh is the cost of living crisis

745
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,039
very acute in Europe and this video I

746
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,340
did saying hey how much worse is going

747
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,919
to get so far so good uh in Europe at

748
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,779
least is because we had this very mild

749
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,000
weather so I talked about these

750
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,520
different scenarios saying you know you

751
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,460
have the mild recessing scenario a bad

752
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,320
recession and an apocalyptic recession

753
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,320
depending on the weather what Putin will

754
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,200
do next uh how fast we can move to

755
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,940
alternative energy sources and so far in

756
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,399
Europe

757
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,960
um even though uh energy price is still

758
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,340
way too high uh the weather was amazing

759
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,500
except for last week when it was super

760
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,440
cold and that has a huge impact on

761
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,899
demand but then even even taking that

762
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,520
into account demand was reduced in in

763
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,779
countries like here in Belgium by 20

764
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,260
percent

765
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:06,419
purely because people were saving uh

766
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,840
energy usage

767
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:11,580
um or maybe buying solar panels but also

768
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,260
just turning the heat down I turned it

769
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:18,059
down here from

770
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,679
normally 20 to 18 uh degrees a Celsius

771
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,120
that is

772
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,260
and actually you know if you wear a

773
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,200
Christmas sweater

774
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,240
uh to me that's not a big big problem uh

775
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,640
I would say and it saves a ton of energy

776
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,940
and I was also talking to

777
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,279
um my research intern here Oscar who uh

778
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,380
is German and had these contacts in the

779
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,419
German industry who would say you know

780
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,679
uh German industry cut back a lot and

781
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,299
then some economists would say yeah

782
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,640
that's super negative because that means

783
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:48,059
they're not producing so much anymore

784
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,640
and then he said well anecdotally some

785
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:52,679
of these factories were just going uh

786
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,539
you know have a careful look at their

787
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,720
production process and they saw all of

788
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:00,240
these uh big inefficiencies you know

789
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,419
burning the the the furnace way too high

790
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,059
it's not necessary and I think for many

791
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,820
households it was similar you can but

792
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:12,539
you can buy this little uh pillow uh put

793
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,399
it under the door so that it doesn't

794
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,279
um that doesn't come so much wind

795
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,640
through it right and I think a lot of of

796
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,840
that also happened uh cold showers uh

797
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:28,380
way you know shorter showers 20 demand

798
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,820
reduction so these two elements that I

799
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,500
talked about in that video Europe's

800
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,799
upcoming recession

801
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:36,919
so far seem to have really uh helped at

802
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,919
least

803
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,899
so

804
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,120
um

805
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:44,039
okay kindness lupus thank you so much

806
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,299
for supporting Channel first of all and

807
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,940
you're saying but what about Germany

808
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:50,580
cost of living here is rocketing now

809
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,860
this this is still true right uh it here

810
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,620
in Belgium as well the cost of living is

811
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,539
still Sky High going up depending a

812
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,419
little bit on if you had if you have to

813
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,640
reveal your energy contract

814
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,039
um this is inflation right this is the

815
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
still I'm not uh saying this is not

816
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,480
another big problem

817
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,640
uh it's it's still the case it was just

818
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,460
that we expected three months ago for it

819
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,840
to be so much worse even still because

820
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,320
of energy

821
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,600
uh but it's uh it's still a problem okay

822
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,059
this is interesting uh okay this is

823
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,880
difficult name to pronounce but y p e y

824
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:29,399
one says if the Germans are inefficient

825
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,740
I'm starting to worry look let me tell

826
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,720
you something controversial uh being a

827
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,559
Dutchman and this kind of lamb in hot

828
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,360
Waters Germany is not so efficient

829
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,600
okay they have the reputation for being

830
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,980
super efficient uh but it could be a lot

831
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,200
more efficient

832
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,380
um in my humble opinion

833
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,880
uh conversion opinion of that I'm not

834
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,220
going to explain it too much more people

835
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,039
please defend Germany in the chat

836
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,140
against such an outrageous claim

837
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,980
but coming from the Netherlands I would

838
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,440
say

839
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,760
not as efficient as I had expected

840
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,919
room for improvement and they're

841
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,120
improving right so that's good

842
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,060
okay

843
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,060
so these are in my opinion the biggest

844
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,099
stories of the global economy in 2022

845
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,399
inflation

846
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,980
the economic War China slowdown currency

847
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,260
crises in many countries including the

848
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,480
United Kingdom and the huge cost of

849
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,859
living crisis in many many countries

850
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,859
prominently also in Europe

851
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,240
yes

852
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:37,320
Germans

853
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,119
Raul agrees with me uh

854
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,619
some people are saying that this is

855
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,879
exactly what a German would say and it

856
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,220
could be true

857
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,040
all right uh let's see

858
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,200
so I'm also going to talk about how much

859
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,080
these themes will likely work into next

860
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,859
year but uh we're gonna get to that

861
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,300
let's first now start with uh oh I just

862
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:59,099
wanted to mention and there's a shout

863
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,200
out to the plain bagel great uh Channel

864
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,940
if you're into Finance he also talks

865
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,099
about economy sometimes the biggest

866
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,440
story I miss I really said about it I

867
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,960
prepared the whole video or I prepared a

868
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,780
lot of research for it

869
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,599
the crash of the bound they managed to

870
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,980
stabilize it so far but I was just

871
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,180
working on too many videos at the time

872
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,520
to cover it

873
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,140
I think what had been said about it is

874
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,960
that they had this current account

875
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,020
deficit it was very stupid moved then to

876
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,020
tax cuts for the rich and they also I

877
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,000
think uh spent a lot of money on making

878
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,460
the energy prices lower and that the

879
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,680
controversial thing about that is you

880
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,140
know that that does help people but then

881
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,180
they also don't reduce their demand so

882
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,280
much and your problem that energy prices

883
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,500
are still Sky High is still there and

884
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,420
it's just more difficult if you have a

885
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,540
current account deficit

886
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,660
I would like to add to that that the UK

887
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,820
has had this business model for a long

888
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,560
time or economic model

889
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,700
where they wanted to be the banker of

890
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,380
the world London is still as big of a

891
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,079
financial center as

892
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,079
New York whereas the UK is no longer the

893
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,680
global superpower that it was back

894
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,339
uh you know in the 30s right

895
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,920
strange so what they did is they courted

896
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:23,540
Europeans London is your Europe's

897
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,440
Banking Center and they quoted a lot of

898
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,500
let's say

899
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,700
less Democratic rulers and Elites from

900
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,680
less wealthy countries put it like this

901
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,660
that's why they say London is is London

902
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,740
grad and you have all of this Russian

903
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,160
money there

904
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,700
now what's happening uh first with

905
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,260
brexit they make their banking center

906
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,960
and they're there for their currency

907
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,900
much less attractive to the Europeans

908
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,579
okay which is you know they had their

909
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,940
reasons but

910
00:36:53,579 --> 00:37:00,119
that doesn't help the pound uh as as a

911
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,579
major investment destination then they

912
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,560
now they have these sanctions which you

913
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,480
know is uh

914
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,880
makes makes a lot of sense politically

915
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,380
speaking but what can it makes sense

916
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,820
then that the consequence is that a lot

917
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,260
of Russian money is being pulled out of

918
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,859
London because it's no longer the safe

919
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,839
haven then maybe a lot of other similar

920
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,940
type money is also going to think twice

921
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,980
about putting all of that in the UK and

922
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,200
that might be a good thing

923
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,900
but

924
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,300
it also just makes the pound less

925
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,040
attractive it decreases the demand for

926
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,660
the pound and so I think it makes sense

927
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,400
that if you look at the

928
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,920
the exchange rate of the pundit has been

929
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,099
falling for for years now for 10 years

930
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,839
like if you zoom out if you cut through

931
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:46,260
the noise a little bit you'll see that

932
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,780
this latest collapse is just that it's

933
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,240
this latest collapse it's not oh

934
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,460
listro's collapse the bound and that's

935
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,339
the whole story no I think there's more

936
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,280
to it I think their economic model the

937
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:00,960
source of demand for pounds is under

938
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
pressure and that's why I want to make a

939
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,500
video about

940
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,720
still in my archive

941
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,180
maybe it will come out next year

942
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,079
depending on what happens with the with

943
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,579
the brown

944
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,200
so that's a little preview and that's

945
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,180
the biggest story I missed and if you

946
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,940
want to get the details more on the

947
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,859
financial side shout outs to the plain

948
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,119
bagel and also Patrick Boyle who covered

949
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:24,359
this story from the financial

950
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,820
perspective really well

951
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:26,579
I would say

952
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,260
[Music]

953
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:33,540
um

954
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,540
all right some chats about this

955
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,040
uh okay lots of cheddar uh

956
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,220
Harry says UK is a bigger better

957
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,480
developed version of Lebanon there is

958
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,700
actually a little bit of Truth there is

959
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,800
right in the sense that Lebanon was the

960
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,540
preeminent financial center of the

961
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,619
Middle East it was this stable Safe

962
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:58,859
Haven uh which now has shifted to Dubai

963
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,300
and Lebanon uh yeah has terrible economy

964
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,640
at the moment I wouldn't say it's like

965
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,040
that bad I know there's still a lot of

966
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,920
amazing research there's a lot of still

967
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,180
amazing fundamentals also in the UK but

968
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,440
um I get where you're coming from with

969
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,440
that when you say that

970
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,359
uh okay so this is uh kabil Yuri maybe

971
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,980
you should do Pakistan before next year

972
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:21,420
to give the rest of hope it can't get

973
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,359
worse than here

974
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,880
um yeah and that's uh sadly uh I know

975
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:29,400
this is uh this is the case in the sense

976
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,980
that there has been these huge floods in

977
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,099
Pakistan as well uh

978
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,820
yeah their economy is terrible at the

979
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,480
moment

980
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,700
um

981
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,040
I would like to cover it uh although

982
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,500
let's put it like this I hope I I hope

983
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,200
it don't wasn't will not get worse and

984
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,680
then I don't have to cover it

985
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:52,800
um so best of luck there

986
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,500
all right so we get to the reviewing

987
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,020
part of the uh

988
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,240
of the session let's review

989
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,760
the global economy so this is not your

990
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,920
own economy this is the global economy

991
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,180
because I cannot review all economies in

992
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,720
the world

993
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,420
2021 a real GDP so this chart from the

994
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,240
World Bank the global economy is in

995
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,339
steep slow down the blue line was uh

996
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,839
sort of the projected line uh you know

997
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,240
before covet

998
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,599
red line up to where you see these

999
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,320
diverging lines is where

1000
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,900
we are now so we have seen real economic

1001
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,880
growth uh even though there's miscayo

1002
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,040
inflation and that makes sense right in

1003
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,220
the sense that the economy took such a

1004
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,140
beating in 2020 you know these and and

1005
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,300
partially in 2021 still all of these

1006
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,240
lockdowns come on that that had to have

1007
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,300
had a serious effect this was absolutely

1008
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,440
massive I think economists at least or

1009
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,960
people talking about economies should

1010
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,280
appreciate more how big this uh this

1011
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,240
shock is how you would say than

1012
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,339
economics was so so big

1013
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,839
um and you know we have recovered from

1014
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:04,380
it but we're

1015
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,180
we're below our our path that we were on

1016
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,220
is so this is how you should read this

1017
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,920
graph and then the World Bank makes this

1018
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,900
sort of scenario analysis saying oh you

1019
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,520
know Baseline we keep growing like this

1020
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,560
but we're never returning according to

1021
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,380
them to to that previous path so this

1022
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,760
lasting damage from the pandemic makes

1023
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,099
sense

1024
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,140
um but it could could even be a bit

1025
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,820
worse

1026
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,800
so real GDP uh has grown so we're going

1027
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,760
to review it right so please get ready

1028
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,579
to give this some some marks some scale

1029
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,680
of let's use a scale of

1030
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,240
one to ten shall we do that scale of one

1031
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,720
to ten

1032
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,619
um 10 being good uh is perfect one being

1033
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,480
ex the worst ever uh maybe uh something

1034
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:55,260
I think the worst economic collapse has

1035
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:00,420
been uh in countries like Ukraine

1036
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:04,140
uh Libya Pakistan Haiti Sri Lanka that

1037
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,520
that would be maybe like uh a three just

1038
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,820
to give some

1039
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:13,200
some perspective on how to create this

1040
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:16,740
anyway uh yes it's not it's it's been

1041
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,079
Stellar growth has been fairly high but

1042
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,579
nothing spectacular also if you look at

1043
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,099
the trend that it was on previously

1044
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,680
fairly similar and it doesn't seem to be

1045
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,780
that we're catching up so also makes

1046
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,320
sense that people aren't are pessimistic

1047
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,320
about this right

1048
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,720
then uh winners and losers so had a look

1049
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,960
at some countries that extremely well or

1050
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,800
not so well uh Saudi Arabia big winner

1051
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,020
of uh 20 20 lit up 2022 when we look at

1052
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,020
real GDP

1053
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,540
plus a real GPA so correct for inflation

1054
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,520
plus 9.8 percent is from one of my

1055
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,599
sources if you're gonna google you might

1056
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,660
find slightly different numbers

1057
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:02,220
depending on the source here I used uh

1058
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:05,640
the oec oecd yeah for this one India 6.6

1059
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,680
also surprising uh surprisingly high in

1060
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,400
list India did actually really well this

1061
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,200
year

1062
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,300
could also be that they had a bad year

1063
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,420
last year's which you always should give

1064
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,000
into account but uh Saudi Arabia for

1065
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,339
obvious reasons right oil prices through

1066
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,220
the roof what were the winners Qatar

1067
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:27,240
Norway Saudi Arabia

1068
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:30,119
you United Arab Emirates including Dubai

1069
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,760
but losers

1070
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,920
Ukraine

1071
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,500
makes sense I would say but still Let's

1072
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,319
uh just look in horror at this number

1073
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,079
minus 35

1074
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:45,420
GDP real GDP growth for Ukraine

1075
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:49,020
makes sense uh but then surprising to me

1076
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,180
Libya minus 18.5 percent

1077
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,880
and that's strange because Libya's main

1078
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,619
export is oil so you could have expected

1079
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,660
things to improve there

1080
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,240
I looked into it it was a bit difficult

1081
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,920
to find what uh the most convincing

1082
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,920
reason I could find is that the security

1083
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,740
situation there is really bad again so

1084
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,260
maybe not maybe not I'm not sure if

1085
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,599
anyone in the chat is there or has super

1086
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:15,660
as much pure political knowledge there

1087
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,900
but maybe not full official Civil War

1088
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,900
but still a high sort of disorder chaos

1089
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,740
um some other countries did Super poorly

1090
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,500
I couldn't find their numbers here in

1091
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,839
the OCD database but Sri Lanka Haiti

1092
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Afghanistan as well covered it in a

1093
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,280
video Pakistan terrible some of these

1094
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,980
were highly inflationary Afghanistan not

1095
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,119
so inflationary but because

1096
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:44,760
strange story they outsourced their

1097
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,619
money printer and then that was

1098
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,720
sanctioned and so they actually couldn't

1099
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,099
make any more money there and the

1100
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,300
banking system the private bank system

1101
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:55,680
was also

1102
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,780
at odds with uh Sharia law so you know

1103
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,540
not functioning properly after Taliban

1104
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,800
took over so that there you might see

1105
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:07,380
money printing can be a factor for sure

1106
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,780
so they had deflationary or or still

1107
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:14,640
inflationary if I remember correctly but

1108
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:19,680
not as high as Sri Lanka Pakistan Haiti

1109
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,680
Russia still minus 3.9 so yes

1110
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,200
they did much better than expected after

1111
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,420
the first sanctions hit but come on

1112
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,780
that's still really bad like if that was

1113
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,599
real GDP growth in the United States uh

1114
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,260
I think or you had way more Doom videos

1115
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,760
on YouTube than you had now

1116
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,900
so

1117
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,180
um

1118
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,220
yeah though I'm just gonna give an

1119
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,380
overview that's the idea here

1120
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,099
so what would you say sort of given this

1121
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,880
like okay we had a fair GDP growth

1122
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:53,579
um

1123
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,859
like overall right but we didn't catch

1124
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:58,440
up and that's a real shame after ideally

1125
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:00,000
after lockdowns all over the world the

1126
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,560
economy should bounce back to where it

1127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,260
was right that that's what you you would

1128
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,280
hope that didn't happen lasting lasting

1129
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,520
impact

1130
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,960
what would you score it a scale of one

1131
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,560
to ten

1132
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,220
one being worst 10 being perfect

1133
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,800
um

1134
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,560
three being

1135
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,579
countries that like Libya

1136
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,780
Ukraine okay so so uh just let me know

1137
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:28,560
in the chat

1138
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,819
I am uh leaning towards

1139
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,640
because we're not talking about

1140
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:36,420
inflation yet I'm leaning towards A6 out

1141
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,339
of 10. that's my opinion so uh let me

1142
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,500
know what you think and then I I can

1143
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:43,380
adjust it a little bit

1144
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,319
April April says 4 out of ten

1145
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,119
I do like six

1146
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:49,920
the name is I do like and he says six I

1147
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:54,800
do like six okay

1148
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,800
uh let me see if I can actually

1149
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,300
I can end the poll six six five five uh

1150
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,500
seven

1151
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,500
all right seven

1152
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,460
okay what I'm gonna do is like I'm gonna

1153
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,440
say

1154
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:27,500
7 is too high this is the pool going to

1155
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,500
be

1156
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,980
because I see some let me know uh please

1157
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,079
vote do vote quickly

1158
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:41,099
because I see it most answers around

1159
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,319
seven uh and then uh sixes fives I

1160
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,960
haven't seen so many

1161
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:49,099
nobody's going above me yes it's too

1162
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,579
high 70 says too high

1163
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:56,400
5.5 out of 10 by Juan adjusting from a

1164
00:47:53,579 --> 00:48:01,440
six but maybe that's a rounding error

1165
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:06,359
so yeah okay 75 thinking it's too high

1166
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,160
okay seven was my base uh six was my

1167
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,480
oh wait I said six and now I'm saying

1168
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,500
seven is too high is a question well

1169
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,440
okay

1170
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:17,460
what is this yeah I see some sevens okay

1171
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,380
seven is too high then that was my bet

1172
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,079
for asking the wrong question but then

1173
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,540
let's say it's a six is what I'm getting

1174
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,839
from from all of you so that was fairly

1175
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:32,099
important six real GDP

1176
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,440
review of the global economy okay

1177
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:38,480
that's real GDP but now to the real

1178
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,480
story uh really beat a real story

1179
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,319
inflation this this let's let's just say

1180
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:46,880
like this 2022 was the year of inflation

1181
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,880
the year that inflation came back

1182
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:54,560
um so what you see here is a map of uh

1183
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:57,240
the World by the IMF uh colors

1184
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,760
indicating the sort of orangey is is

1185
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,800
high inflation the more orange you get

1186
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,920
the higher your inflation is The Greener

1187
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,900
you get you get low inflation and green

1188
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,760
inflation in their opinion is roughly

1189
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,680
around the target of two percent right

1190
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,839
so China

1191
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,900
roughly around two percent

1192
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:18,740
Saudi Arabia there we have them again uh

1193
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,740
roughly around two percent

1194
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,500
and then yeah I just wanted to show you

1195
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:30,200
this chart in the bottom left corner

1196
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:32,700
which is uh coal and gas gold oil prices

1197
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,560
and this is it goes back a long time and

1198
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,619
I think you can see here that the shock

1199
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:41,040
we've seen here is is almost equivalent

1200
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:42,300
to what we saw in uh the 80s great oil

1201
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,579
crisis

1202
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,680
that that had a huge and lasting impact

1203
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:49,440
on the economics profession and that was

1204
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,420
also the maybe coincidentally the last

1205
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,280
time that we saw this this massive

1206
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,140
inflation

1207
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,839
so I think that was definitely the

1208
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,420
biggest Factor another uh key uh point

1209
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:02,940
of evidence that I I you know I've seen

1210
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,460
for that is that at the start of the

1211
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,020
year it was all about U.S inflation and

1212
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,940
now it's all about European inflation

1213
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,940
who uh was closest to

1214
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,420
um the Russian gas and had the most

1215
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,640
energy inflation Europe

1216
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:20,099
so that I don't think many people will

1217
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,780
disagree with that anymore

1218
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,339
but

1219
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,020
um

1220
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:28,500
some positive news that's the second

1221
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:31,380
chart that is global Shipping rate so at

1222
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,300
the start of 2022 everybody was like oh

1223
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,040
people are locked down inside they're

1224
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,500
ordering all their stuff from China and

1225
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,680
not going to a bar anymore that trend

1226
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:43,140
has reversed and so

1227
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:46,380
uh it seems to be that Global Supply

1228
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,240
chains are going back to normal uh

1229
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,880
Freight rate so that means like how

1230
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,880
expensive it is to send a package from

1231
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,180
one portal to another via ship is really

1232
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,140
now coming down so there are a lot of

1233
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,280
um

1234
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:04,140
uh sort of goods Services goods mainly

1235
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,540
that contribute to inflation last year

1236
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:09,059
that have gone down significantly which

1237
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,819
is hopeful but I'm not gonna

1238
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:14,700
yeah uh might be still overpowered by

1239
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:16,940
another energy increase right so let's

1240
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,940
see

1241
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,800
who winners and losers uh winners had

1242
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,920
low inflation in this case that's why

1243
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,839
you see them there so Japan

1244
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:31,079
1.99 inflation there I've seen some

1245
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:34,920
other sources three percent but this one

1246
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:38,220
I found China 2.2 Saudi Arabia 2.9 and

1247
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,140
also interestingly Switzerland

1248
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,859
three percent inflation

1249
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,480
strange right uh maybe my hypothesis was

1250
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,339
wrong Switzerland's also in the middle

1251
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,520
of Europe they should also have Sky

1252
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:54,180
inflation if it was Russian energy right

1253
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:57,240
Japan also uh Imports a lot of uh energy

1254
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:00,780
also from Russia so

1255
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,119
China doesn't but China so for China

1256
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,460
there's the the economy seems to be

1257
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,559
slowing down so much that demands so low

1258
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,420
that

1259
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,280
uh yeah that this has contributed to

1260
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:16,020
them having very low inflation Saudi

1261
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,800
Arabia is maybe selling uh oil cheaper

1262
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,480
in the country and uh is is uh using its

1263
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,040
uh its massive gains from from all of

1264
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,339
that oil

1265
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,780
to uh to to compensate uh partially the

1266
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:30,839
population

1267
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,819
so Switzerland and Japan Mysteries I

1268
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,260
looked into it a little bit uh what I

1269
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:36,599
found is that

1270
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,040
Switzerland uh had there's a couple of

1271
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:40,260
factors the

1272
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,559
Swiss currency went up like crazy making

1273
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,599
All Imports uh cheaper because uh likely

1274
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,460
because the Central Bank raised interest

1275
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,380
rates and maybe because it's a safe

1276
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,839
haven in Europe typically

1277
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:55,680
uh maybe especially with with what was

1278
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:58,200
going on in the UK not entirely sure but

1279
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,480
um their currency went up a lot

1280
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,300
so that contributed if your currency

1281
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,040
gets uh worth way more All Imports

1282
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,040
including energy is cheaper right

1283
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,619
another thing

1284
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:15,900
they're really relying on um

1285
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:18,780
a lot of renewable energy apparently

1286
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,160
hydropower

1287
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,260
on top of that they had some price

1288
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,480
controls uh more than other European

1289
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,520
countries in the article that I read at

1290
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,980
least and Japan also apparently has

1291
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,160
quite a lot of price controls on

1292
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,280
energy and wheat especially meaning that

1293
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,440
producers cannot

1294
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,020
cannot hike their prices so much they

1295
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,780
have to do it in small steps so if you

1296
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,300
have that then you know you likely have

1297
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,640
lesser less inflation but you might

1298
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,520
expect that a lot of your producers will

1299
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,740
get in trouble but yeah

1300
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,319
these are the best explanations that I

1301
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,819
could find for these strange cases so to

1302
00:53:55,319 --> 00:54:00,260
see I mean if you look at the world map

1303
00:53:56,819 --> 00:54:00,260
everybody had huge inflation

1304
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:07,980
uh so here I see uh into Europe in the

1305
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,680
chat uh super nice to see you uh Hugo

1306
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,900
from into Europe who's also been using

1307
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,420
the studio here from time time and who

1308
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,480
has made a lot of animations for me uh

1309
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,460
last year so if people uh didn't notice

1310
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,500
maybe my animations got a bit nicer

1311
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,540
because uh Hugo has been helping me out

1312
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,520
from into Europe with with that so huge

1313
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,260
shout out to into Europe and thank you

1314
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,240
for it for joining the chat and thank

1315
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,700
you for contributing and saying yeah the

1316
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,740
there's not so much natural gas usage in

1317
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:38,520
Switzerland

1318
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:40,619
Oliver thank you so much uh for uh

1319
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,420
contributing to the channel and he says

1320
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:46,319
Japan is taking to zero percent interest

1321
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:49,619
rates which helps to create a deflation

1322
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,380
um yeah I wonder but there uh arguably

1323
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,480
that also uh led to this collapse in the

1324
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,420
Yen which should have

1325
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,819
uh increased in uh inflation right if

1326
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,819
their currency is going down so hmm

1327
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:09,420
yeah

1328
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:12,119
all right uh

1329
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,180
yeah Buxton P says that the DNS lost a

1330
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:17,280
lot right so yeah that's uh that's it's

1331
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,500
a mystery maybe actually I should once

1332
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,920
again return to Japan next year with a

1333
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:26,339
more continued analysis but let's see

1334
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:29,339
okay let's go to losers uh of this year

1335
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:32,339
uh not talked about so much in the news

1336
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:36,000
still the biggest losers like absolutely

1337
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:38,099
crazy inflation 200 percent uh and one

1338
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,319
for Venezuela I think

1339
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:42,599
Sudan also 180 or something something

1340
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,599
like that very high numbers

1341
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,760
these are just countries that are in um

1342
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,040
in sort of a collapsing state right like

1343
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,960
the their their huge government failure

1344
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,599
the currency that the government issues

1345
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,099
typically if you this is something when

1346
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,260
I did these inflation videos on

1347
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,940
hyperinflation all of that always most

1348
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,280
countries that have hyperinflation

1349
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:05,400
either have huge current account deficit

1350
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,440
so uh their currency then collapses

1351
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,500
because they try to import they have to

1352
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,079
import so much uh and they they bring

1353
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,700
their own money to the to the Foreign

1354
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:17,940
Exchange Market nobody wants it so the

1355
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:20,520
value goes down second case is uh when a

1356
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,599
government collapses uh a currency is a

1357
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,819
liability

1358
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,859
is that from the government from the

1359
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:27,599
central bank if a government collapses

1360
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:30,059
it's absolutely worthless it can no

1361
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:32,520
longer enforce you to use that currency

1362
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,680
I think this is uh and they might also

1363
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,440
be printing money that's that that could

1364
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,540
also definitely be true but definitely

1365
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,880
often happens as a reaction to either of

1366
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:44,400
these two things because then either the

1367
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,559
choices don't pay any wages anymore or

1368
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,660
print the money and the print money is

1369
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,819
less painful at that moment but

1370
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,619
you know the real problem is this insane

1371
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:53,940
current account deficit or a collapsing

1372
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:57,240
government

1373
00:56:53,940 --> 00:57:02,099
uh so either you just go down in a huge

1374
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:05,220
deflationary spiral or or hyperinflation

1375
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:08,099
sadly Sudan and Venezuela

1376
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:10,640
getting close to that uh also less

1377
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:13,859
talked about this year Argentino

1378
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,880
number I found to 72 percent I also

1379
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:19,260
found somewhere that they're getting

1380
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:21,000
close now to 90 percent so maybe I

1381
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,420
should do a video about that next year

1382
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,480
they have a highly dollarized economy

1383
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:30,660
which is the same as turkey and turkey

1384
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,720
also has a super high inflation

1385
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:36,359
this was covered quite well I also made

1386
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:38,280
a video about it

1387
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:39,900
most people were saying it's interest

1388
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:45,119
rates

1389
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:47,160
uh I think it contributed for sure but

1390
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,540
hugely dollarized economy what has the

1391
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,000
government done they have now

1392
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,240
implemented this new policy called a

1393
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,040
literaryation instead of dollarization

1394
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,200
liraisation and that actually seemed to

1395
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,880
have worked a little bit because the

1396
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,880
Lira has now stabilized a little bit

1397
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,280
after a super long fall

1398
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,260
but they also use some other tricks and

1399
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,020
that is what my next video will be about

1400
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,940
which I think I will likely release on

1401
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,400
Thursday so in two days so that's that

1402
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:16,980
will be the final video for

1403
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,780
um for this year for money macro

1404
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,700
then also big loser on the inflation

1405
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,400
front Eastern Europe especially the

1406
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:24,900
baltics uh that were super Reliant the

1407
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,119
more you really see this pattern the

1408
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:30,000
more Reliant you were in Russian gas the

1409
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,880
higher your inflation is now

1410
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
have I missed any winners or losers in

1411
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,160
your opinion let me know and otherwise I

1412
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,400
think we're gonna go to vote here uh

1413
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:45,359
what is uh the score for

1414
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,640
the global economy regarding inflation

1415
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,220
again

1416
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:54,119
well actually let's say that here's uh

1417
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:55,920
Sudan and Venezuela score a uh one just

1418
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,260
to say like how bad hyperinflation

1419
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,640
actually really is so that's the the the

1420
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:04,200
one

1421
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:06,900
um let's give uh Japan in this case

1422
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,220
let's give them a um a nine two percent

1423
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,859
inflation

1424
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:12,660
in this environment uh is great right

1425
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:13,859
like they they were they wanted a little

1426
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,660
bit of inflation they have two percent

1427
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:17,900
inflation their target

1428
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:21,180
so Japan is a nine

1429
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:24,420
Venezuela is a one what is the global

1430
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:27,059
economy in in your opinion

1431
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,819
let me know in the comments so that I

1432
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:35,480
can get a bit of an idea

1433
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:35,480
just gonna close that pool previous poll

1434
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,099
[Music]

1435
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,880
um

1436
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:43,500
okay it's trans story then

1437
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:49,760
all right

1438
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:52,819
so I would uh five okay from uh

1439
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:59,220
correctly Harry says

1440
00:59:52,819 --> 01:00:01,619
3.535 if you want better Marie no before

1441
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,440
okay I've broken five summer malicious

1442
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:06,900
six still actually not so bad okay okay

1443
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:11,400
here they're they're coming 4.5 Japan is

1444
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:16,079
a nine yeah that's good four five five

1445
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:19,319
four four five yeah this is uh

1446
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,870
definitely worse than the GDP score

1447
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:26,210
so I would uh agree with uh this

1448
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,210
[Music]

1449
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:29,579
okay

1450
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:34,319
five I think I would also would would

1451
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,000
have been the thing that came to mind

1452
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:38,220
for me

1453
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,079
so five out of ten is what I would say

1454
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,940
because

1455
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,520
um

1456
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:46,799
because uh Venezuela's the one you know

1457
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,180
globally they're still

1458
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,780
um

1459
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:54,540
I I might um

1460
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,359
go even a bit lower otherwise but okay

1461
01:00:54,540 --> 01:01:01,859
I'm gonna say let's start a ball

1462
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,760
so is uh so I think five is on the high

1463
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:05,760
side

1464
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:10,980
but might be correct so I would say is

1465
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:13,799
is a five two high for Global inflation

1466
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,240
score that my question to you is it too

1467
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:17,940
high so

1468
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,160
if many people vote Yes it's too high

1469
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,799
and then we're going to lower it to four

1470
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:27,559
I'd say

1471
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,559
so you should Now by now see this poll

1472
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:35,280
uh yes no and no vote

1473
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:37,799
so let's see global inflation terrible

1474
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,299
year and then we can move on to happier

1475
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:42,299
news after this

1476
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:42,299
yes

1477
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,180
five Daniel says five feels like a very

1478
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:50,220
average year this year has been really

1479
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,680
bad here for the economy four is the

1480
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:55,319
best case

1481
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,819
I would say like uh the the what I

1482
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:00,359
typically use in a one to ten score

1483
01:01:56,819 --> 01:02:01,740
let's say for grading students is a six

1484
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:05,040
is sufficient

1485
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:07,460
a seven is like what you average

1486
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,900
uh

1487
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,640
vote no please is

1488
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:16,700
people are saying this actually close

1489
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,700
call 54 says uh

1490
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:26,280
I think no 55 okay I'm gonna end it

1491
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:29,339
and then see what the result was

1492
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:34,079
um okay no it's not too high so we're

1493
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:38,280
gonna stay with a 5 54 so inflation

1494
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:44,359
2022 a five a place in 2020.

1495
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:44,359
final so now we have a six for real GDP

1496
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:51,000
there we go five for inflation and

1497
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,920
next up unemployment

1498
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,220
so let's talk about unemployment because

1499
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:59,460
I think with all the Doom and Gloom uh

1500
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:02,760
this hasn't been talked about enough

1501
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,799
and it's also something that

1502
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,920
um you might not talk about

1503
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:10,500
enough because most people in most

1504
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,680
countries are employed

1505
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,420
right so uh for most people even though

1506
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,780
they read about this in the paper and

1507
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,599
this is not such a big issue even if

1508
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,819
there is high unemployment although I've

1509
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,180
lived in South Africa for a while

1510
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:28,559
you do notice uh I I would say that you

1511
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,780
would not sit on the street you feel

1512
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,000
inequality is not a nice feeling I I

1513
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,680
would say but for most people who are

1514
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,720
employed this is perhaps less top of

1515
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,660
mind but I would argue it's very

1516
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,640
important and especially youth

1517
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,559
unemployment because if you have youth

1518
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,359
unemployment for a long time you get

1519
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:49,380
this really disillusioned young people

1520
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:51,059
especially men higher crime

1521
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,099
and also they don't get a chance to

1522
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:55,799
develop right it takes time you need a

1523
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:57,900
job like anyone if you've had a job in

1524
01:03:55,799 --> 01:04:00,000
10 years or maybe you've had a job for

1525
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,380
10 years you get better at it right if

1526
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,119
you don't have a job ever you never get

1527
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,140
better at it so for an economy super

1528
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,319
important

1529
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:09,000
I think a bit underrated unemployment

1530
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:11,880
so let's look at these graphs so I try

1531
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,680
to highlight some countries uh it has

1532
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,260
been trending down for most countries

1533
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,700
unemployment is fairly low

1534
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,960
and this might have contributed to

1535
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:22,200
inflation

1536
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,819
but let's let's celebrate this and also

1537
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,040
let's have a look at countries like

1538
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:29,040
Spain and Greece these are the top two

1539
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:32,220
lines in the chart who've seen their

1540
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:36,680
employment unemployment rates go from in

1541
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:40,920
the 20s to in the High Teens so 12 13

1542
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:43,140
which is still absolutely way too high

1543
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,040
okay let's just be clear about that but

1544
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,380
still

1545
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,480
there's finally something positive to

1546
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,660
say here positive trend

1547
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,760
however then two points I want to make

1548
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:57,900
about this

1549
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,160
uh one is youth unemployment so China

1550
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,599
was in the news now that youth

1551
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,900
unemployment was actually going up quite

1552
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,760
a bit up to 20 which is precisely what I

1553
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:09,740
was talking about is so bad it's one of

1554
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,420
the worst forms of uh unemployment

1555
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:15,000
uh and okay

1556
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,480
this is a headline from The Economist in

1557
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,780
developing countries many

1558
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:24,839
many people cannot afford not to work

1559
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,400
meaning that uh the the because I looked

1560
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:28,260
at statistics and southern Europe is

1561
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,079
always super bad South Africa as well

1562
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,359
and then uh southeast Asia for example

1563
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,240
some very poor countries very low

1564
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,040
unemployment numbers so I found it quite

1565
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,420
strange but apparently what happens

1566
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,040
there is that people often don't

1567
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,799
register for unemployment benefits

1568
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,920
because this is so so poorly organized

1569
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:49,319
that it's more of a hassle or it costs

1570
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,359
money or or effort or money right

1571
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:54,900
instead of hustling on the street to

1572
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,480
register so okay the statistics uh are

1573
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:59,940
not as accurate for the whole world

1574
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,220
for this but uh

1575
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:04,680
still a downward Trend at least in

1576
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:06,900
advanced economies

1577
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,319
uh let's let's have some positive news

1578
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,319
as well

1579
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,980
uh winners so advanced economies on

1580
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,339
average down to four and a half percent

1581
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:19,380
from 6.6 or something last year which is

1582
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:21,420
great

1583
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,400
Spain agrees like I mentioned and the

1584
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,500
rest of southern Europe uh winners

1585
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,079
notably in this category even though

1586
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:31,140
it's still really bad unemployment so

1587
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,119
nothing to celebrate 13 unemployment but

1588
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:35,099
if you're used to 20 that's much better

1589
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,160
and I also read some economic

1590
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:40,079
commentators talking about how great it

1591
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,640
is that now the economies are open again

1592
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,680
the tourists are going back to southern

1593
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,859
Europe which is great for these

1594
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,980
economies

1595
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:52,020
uh some losers South Africa uh I had a

1596
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:55,319
look at that their unemployment rate the

1597
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:57,900
trend is absolutely very worrying 34

1598
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:59,640
unemployment and that it it's like this

1599
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,960
line that's only going up it's not going

1600
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,539
up uh

1601
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,480
straight up but it's it's only it's a

1602
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:08,880
trend rather than what you see here the

1603
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,339
world trend is downwards South Africa

1604
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,220
trend is upwards and they and 34

1605
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:17,099
employment I mean that's that's crazy uh

1606
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:19,319
I lived in South Africa you can see this

1607
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,599
industry you can definitely see it it's

1608
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:24,660
really terrible so

1609
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,720
the losers in this regard given that the

1610
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,280
data for many countries because maybe

1611
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,260
there are many African countries that

1612
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,599
have this problem but it doesn't show up

1613
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,460
in the data

1614
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,140
youth unemployment also important to

1615
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:40,319
talk about China is a loser in that

1616
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,880
regard this year I would say you also

1617
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:45,059
have there this this has been the news

1618
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,680
quite a bit this trend that uh you know

1619
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,299
lying flat is what they call it that

1620
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,039
people young people are getting so

1621
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:53,099
desperate to get a job

1622
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,200
um that situation here has really in in

1623
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:57,299
Europe has really disappeared a little

1624
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,280
bit 10 years ago

1625
01:07:57,299 --> 01:08:00,960
and that's quite remarkable because 10

1626
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,420
years ago or something it was much more

1627
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,880
difficult for people like my students I

1628
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:08,880
was the instrument to get to find a job

1629
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,859
and now my students are are having no

1630
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,920
trouble finding a job so

1631
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:15,599
still Sky inflating inflation is eating

1632
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,339
away at their wage but at least they

1633
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,440
have a job

1634
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:21,239
okay maybe nice have some good news as

1635
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,000
well but maybe I'm being too optimistic

1636
01:08:21,239 --> 01:08:27,480
uh let me know if that's true

1637
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,660
Thompson's EU is a loser in general or

1638
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:33,060
Unemployment uh on this the trend is

1639
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:35,400
good right but unemployment in the EU is

1640
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:39,120
is much too uh

1641
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:42,199
it's much too high that's true I agree

1642
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:47,699
so uh what would you say unemployment

1643
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:49,799
development in 2022 global economy

1644
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:52,460
great

1645
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:52,460
hi lo

1646
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,759
let me know

1647
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,640
South Africa

1648
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,980
I would say

1649
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,500
is a three

1650
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:06,239
and uh which country has super low

1651
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,679
unemployment

1652
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:10,160
Germany still have super low

1653
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,160
unemployment

1654
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:13,739
I think so Netherlands still yeah really

1655
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,640
low unemployment in the Netherlands at

1656
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:20,040
the moment I think uh Singapore yeah

1657
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,679
let's uh say these kind of countries get

1658
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:26,160
a nine

1659
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:29,640
so what is Switzerland is normally not

1660
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:31,080
considered uh on shoe Mount part of

1661
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,080
southern Europe no

1662
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,080
no

1663
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,020
um okay

1664
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:42,060
I do like says 7.5 Dell season 8

1665
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:45,319
Alexander says a seven

1666
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,940
uh I would say

1667
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:49,679
say a little bit High

1668
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,960
and eight

1669
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,000
um so here zerumo says yeah it's weird

1670
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,060
for me someone who graded out of the 08

1671
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,620
crisis which was me as well

1672
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:01,860
uh where there were no jobs and a bunch

1673
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:04,080
of us had to do schooling or sit board

1674
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,940
yeah exactly so that

1675
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,239
that's not talked about enough right

1676
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:11,360
that this situation has actually changed

1677
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:15,260
I would say

1678
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,820
889 from Lee uh

1679
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:21,360
someone says Europe is good but still

1680
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:24,000
gives it a 10. so okay uh seven seven so

1681
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,460
I would I'm gravitating towards an eight

1682
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,300
for unemployment

1683
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:32,159
uh uh let's say I don't see too many

1684
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,140
people going above that

1685
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,860
so let's see if you think that is too

1686
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,440
high

1687
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,719
uh is

1688
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,100
an eight

1689
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:44,159
too high

1690
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:47,699
for an employee and

1691
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:51,140
globally 2022.

1692
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:51,140
let's do pull

1693
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,420
associate seven eight

1694
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:06,120
so here's zerumo says what's worse

1695
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,980
erosion of their weight in the inflation

1696
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,239
plus housing bubbles or now what we're

1697
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:11,460
having jobs

1698
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:13,440
no clue if it's better or worse for

1699
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,239
Zoomers versus Millennials with a

1700
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,300
10-year different

1701
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:20,640
yeah so this is uh something I talked

1702
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:25,020
about uh with some other economists

1703
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:26,040
during the year that what you see is uh

1704
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,280
that

1705
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:32,040
in voters when you look at voters uh

1706
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:35,340
inflation seems to be a much more hated

1707
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:38,159
than a recession maybe even like people

1708
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:40,320
get really well yeah depending on how

1709
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,420
heavy the recession is but anyway that

1710
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,820
was the hypothesis was there was that

1711
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,920
inflation hits all of us whereas

1712
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,699
unemployment Only Hits a few of us and

1713
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:52,500
when you look at you live in a democracy

1714
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:54,780
then that you know there there's there's

1715
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,280
likely to be a bias towards a hate for

1716
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,140
inflation

1717
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,640
that was hypothesis maybe it's not true

1718
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,440
but uh I thought it was still an

1719
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,960
interesting I hadn't thought about it

1720
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,179
like that uh beforehand

1721
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:09,659
what does to my high mean uh big boss

1722
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:12,120
Big Boss uh it means uh like oh an eight

1723
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,760
is too high of a number so uh you know

1724
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,500
rather unemployment

1725
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,900
2022 should get a seven or a six or a

1726
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,960
five or something like that

1727
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:24,840
okay let's see

1728
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:29,280
well let's end the poll

1729
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,500
and say what do we have uh is it too

1730
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,500
high

1731
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:37,320
uh no says so say most people so it's

1732
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:41,300
not too high so okay again let's just

1733
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,300
gonna stick with an eight

1734
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:51,600
so Unemployment uh gets an eight

1735
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:53,460
inflation A5 and oops GDP is six so it

1736
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,480
wasn't a bad year for the economy

1737
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,239
um

1738
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,760
most people say yes but uh

1739
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:03,239
the the grades aren't are not so so

1740
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,860
insanely bad uh X-Men says he cannot see

1741
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:07,440
the ball I'm sorry

1742
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,880
uh I do not know how to fix this at the

1743
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,340
moment

1744
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,159
final thing final Point global economy

1745
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:17,100
2022 we've done the grading so far is

1746
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:18,960
financial markets uh this is not macro

1747
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:21,600
there's a this is money macro to a

1748
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,679
channel right so money macro we talk

1749
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,040
about

1750
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:29,040
not just financial markets but

1751
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,179
money monetary policy inflation that

1752
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,980
kind of stuff and also sometimes

1753
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:34,980
financial markets

1754
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:38,400
so but we do when we talk about money we

1755
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:40,020
do often talk about gold uh Bitcoin you

1756
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,360
know are they actually the inflation

1757
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:45,840
hedge are they the real types of money

1758
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,980
uh some people uh like to argue

1759
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,100
well

1760
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,719
top chart here uh also possibly because

1761
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,820
why many people think it was terrible

1762
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:57,480
here financial markets had a terrible

1763
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:58,699
year uh the the above two indexes are

1764
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,400
the global

1765
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:04,620
mcsi if I pronounce correctly indexes

1766
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,360
uh this is a long chart so this is over

1767
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,580
a long period of time but the little uh

1768
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:12,239
sort of uh you know downward uh

1769
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:15,780
correction you could say is 2022

1770
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:18,000
of course we had this huge uh bull

1771
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,739
market they would say so a positive uh

1772
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,580
for almost all financial markets going

1773
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:23,820
up

1774
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:25,739
people feeling richer uh also some some

1775
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:28,380
things like houses coming that are

1776
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:30,900
actually used as as consumable Goods as

1777
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,640
well things we actually use getting too

1778
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,380
expensive for many people but the

1779
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,080
homeowners being really happy right

1780
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:40,760
their their values going up

1781
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,760
um or most of them

1782
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,540
but this year no everything went in

1783
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:49,560
Reverse uh

1784
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:51,300
except for energy so energy stocks make

1785
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,219
sense given everything we've talked

1786
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:57,780
about so far with the economic War

1787
01:14:53,219 --> 01:15:00,239
energy War went up gold uh roughly flat

1788
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,679
so going back to inflation discussion at

1789
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,239
the start of the Year someone like Peter

1790
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,760
Schiff says oh we printed too much money

1791
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:08,159
everything's going to go into gold

1792
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,679
he was right on inflation that is the

1793
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,040
inflation went up quite a bit higher but

1794
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:15,719
gold stay flat even in such a high

1795
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,520
inflationary environment so that's

1796
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:19,679
interesting the graph's still going a

1797
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,199
little bit down but gold has recently

1798
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,480
gone up back a little bit so

1799
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:27,360
um that prediction didn't seem to come

1800
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:30,480
true but he did better than the Bitcoin

1801
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,860
Bros which had a terrible year this is

1802
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,280
the Bitcoin price

1803
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:38,580
Bitcoin Pros being a mean term to

1804
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:42,000
describe uh people who really really

1805
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:44,460
into Bitcoin religiously uh so sorry

1806
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,380
about that but Bitcoin had a terrible

1807
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:49,140
year I coined it the crypto's great

1808
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,880
financial crisis because so many crypto

1809
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:53,219
financial institutions went out of

1810
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,739
business they all went into debt with

1811
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:59,000
the Assumption of higher asset prices in

1812
01:15:55,739 --> 01:16:03,739
2021 they were right they got super rich

1813
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,739
and now things have gone into reverse

1814
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,000
um so for financial markets for most

1815
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:11,460
people terrible year I would say

1816
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,679
winners and losers uh winners energy

1817
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,540
stocks if you had what energy stocks you

1818
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,880
actually would have made money I also

1819
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:21,659
asked some some other Finance channels

1820
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:23,460
uh Ben Felix uh plain bagel and uh

1821
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:25,739
Patrick Boyle if they what they thought

1822
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,540
about this and they basically told me

1823
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:29,219
because I don't invest too much myself

1824
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,920
I'm more of an economist

1825
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:34,260
energy stocks are the winners of of this

1826
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,320
year for the rest basically everyone's

1827
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,760
uh losers even though some lost less and

1828
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,100
so they were considered doing this by

1829
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,140
then but that doesn't fly with me

1830
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,719
uh so everything is a loser but

1831
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:50,280
especially tech tech had a terrible year

1832
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:53,340
Amazon down by a lot uh Google that is

1833
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,600
alphabet uh meta from Facebook down by a

1834
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:58,340
lot

1835
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:01,560
uh likely because of uh much lower

1836
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:03,900
advertising prices I read that mobile

1837
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,100
games have had a huge impact on this

1838
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:08,340
because everybody was staying home for

1839
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:10,199
the pandemic buying a mobile games uh

1840
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,940
mobile games doing lots of

1841
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:13,380
advertisements on Instagram and all that

1842
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:16,500
kind of stuff

1843
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:19,380
YouTube perhaps and now less so so

1844
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,600
driving prices down uh hitting also uh

1845
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:26,179
YouTube channels uh advertising Revenue

1846
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:30,120
you can definitely notice uh crypto huge

1847
01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:32,100
loser of uh 2022. sorry for all of you

1848
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,940
invested in crypto

1849
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,580
um

1850
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:38,640
deck as well yeah High interest rates of

1851
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:41,400
course also have a uh in economic theory

1852
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,560
have a big role to play here right so uh

1853
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,480
interest rates going up that kind of

1854
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,480
debt or a bank account becoming more

1855
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:52,020
attractive compared to this risky stocks

1856
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,360
that was also a big factor here probably

1857
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:56,159
yes uh what do you think

1858
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:59,340
[Music]

1859
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:02,960
financial markets what grade shall we

1860
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,960
give this maybe we should say

1861
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:09,420
um for the Baseline scores one to ten

1862
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,960
one is if you had money in FTX that's a

1863
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:16,620
one for you uh probably right

1864
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:18,360
uh 10 if you owned energies no no not a

1865
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,940
10 that's not nine if you owned energy

1866
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:24,000
stocks I would say

1867
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:27,060
so what would you say is um

1868
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,880
financial markets what is is the score

1869
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:32,340
for financial markets this year

1870
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:35,460
seven

1871
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:38,360
okay that's that's pretty good uh 3.5

1872
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,360
from Igor

1873
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:46,020
four seven three

1874
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:47,100
Automotive sector was positive okay I

1875
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:50,520
didn't know that

1876
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:53,400
uh okay makes sense given that uh we had

1877
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:56,100
this huge car shortage still

1878
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:58,380
but yeah it was still positive Tesla is

1879
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,719
definitely not but maybe that's more

1880
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:04,980
Tech stock

1881
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:07,380
four four three five three three six

1882
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:09,960
four five two oh man okay so this is not

1883
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:13,440
so this is not a good year huh four four

1884
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:15,360
five one one from Mark so the global

1885
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,980
stock market uh all asset markets were

1886
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,440
as bad as FTX

1887
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,580
now that's that's bearish as they they

1888
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,679
would say

1889
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:26,400
uh

1890
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:28,080
okay I'm gonna say actually you know

1891
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,719
what I was talking to Patrick ball about

1892
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:33,360
this and he said you know if we look at

1893
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,920
most financial markets uh it this is

1894
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,179
more of a correction still at the moment

1895
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,679
if they don't collapse so much further

1896
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:40,260
because it had this huge increase and

1897
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:43,679
now a correction uh is what he said so

1898
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:45,659
so I'm gonna anchor this at discussion

1899
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,800
at five I'm gonna say I would say five

1900
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:49,800
because

1901
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:52,800
uh crypto had a great financial crisis

1902
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,820
globally asset prices had a terrible

1903
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,400
year

1904
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:58,940
lost money but not a great financial

1905
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:01,560
crisis

1906
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:03,780
uh X-Men doesn't play casino with his

1907
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,420
money so did not invest in FTX I would

1908
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,860
say five so then we're going to say

1909
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:09,900
um

1910
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:12,420
should I say is it too high then yeah

1911
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:15,060
most people were

1912
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:18,060
startup most people were saying it

1913
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:20,540
should be lower four or five threes like

1914
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:25,080
is the Great

1915
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:29,900
five too high for asset markets this

1916
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,900
year that is the question is it too high

1917
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,300
so should it be lower

1918
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,300
my question to you

1919
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,080
let me know what you think is too high

1920
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:46,020
yes

1921
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:49,860
um some contestants

1922
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:52,620
it's always a correction uh

1923
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:55,679
says Royal adomi

1924
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,820
crash only crash if it never recovers

1925
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,860
um

1926
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:00,900
yeah interestingly you know I always

1927
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:02,460
like to look at the from a macro

1928
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:05,580
perspective at the Japanese stock market

1929
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:10,260
how it performed after uh

1930
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:12,060
20 uh 1990 roughly and you know it took

1931
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,560
so long for that to recover which really

1932
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,800
was interesting because sort of the

1933
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,420
common wisdom is always oh yeah on

1934
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,020
average stocks are always going up and

1935
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:24,420
for the US that has been the case uh

1936
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:27,179
at least for 100 years or something but

1937
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,920
for Japan maybe it's now at that level

1938
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:32,460
but like it took 30 years or something

1939
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:35,360
to recover which is terrible right

1940
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,360
uh

1941
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:39,540
spy is below average

1942
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,360
so okay I'm just going to end the ball

1943
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:46,520
quickly so that we can move on

1944
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,520
the Seance says it should be a 4.8

1945
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:52,920
I'm going to end it and is it too high

1946
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,000
yes uh 55 of people says it's too high

1947
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,520
so

1948
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,219
I said a five so it's a four nice

1949
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,239
markets is a four my plan's running at

1950
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:02,400
four

1951
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:05,100
financial markets

1952
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:08,940
for terrible year for financial markets

1953
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:11,600
so that's that's it uh whoops

1954
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:11,600
let's

1955
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:15,840
look at all the numbers again so this

1956
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:17,699
was the review so we're now nearing the

1957
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,880
end of the review section of this live

1958
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:24,179
session measure markets 84 terrible year

1959
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:26,100
real did B6 uh still bad here okay we

1960
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:28,940
want to see a seven at least

1961
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:31,440
uh unemployment and eight

1962
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:33,000
underappreciated hopefully your main

1963
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,980
takeaway from this

1964
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,719
if you're at the Christmas uh dinner

1965
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:39,480
perhaps or some other dinner with

1966
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:41,280
friends or you're at a party hopefully a

1967
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,199
New Year's party

1968
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,000
actually you know if the reading gloomy

1969
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,940
got the economy talk about unemployment

1970
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,320
better than most people think

1971
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:52,199
inflation's still five inflation was the

1972
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:55,040
big bad bad Betty this year

1973
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:55,040
ruined the party

1974
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:01,560
all right uh that's so on average what's

1975
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,020
it on average I'm gonna get in trouble

1976
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,940
not so excited this kind of stuff I need

1977
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,520
to give them weight anyway

1978
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:10,980
I would say on average and this is not a

1979
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:13,860
properly weighted average that's a six

1980
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:15,600
the global economy no let's put it at

1981
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,980
5.5 because inflation was really

1982
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,860
terrible

1983
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:21,360
that is not a not a good year as most of

1984
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,920
you agreed to

1985
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,780
and um

1986
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,980
yeah that sucks

1987
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:27,960
so

1988
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,699
that is the main part of this video out

1989
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:32,699
of the way so we've looked at the the

1990
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:35,640
main stories of 2022 we've reviewed the

1991
01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:38,699
year on these macroeconomic indicators

1992
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:41,159
and now let's do a q a if you want to

1993
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:44,219
stick around stick around otherwise

1994
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:45,840
feel free to leave but this is an open q

1995
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:48,719
a now

1996
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:51,420
and then I would just only have happy

1997
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,679
holidays wish left I'm gonna turn the

1998
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,760
camera

1999
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:57,719
to me

2000
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:00,199
uh hello everybody let's shoot me some

2001
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:00,199
questions

2002
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:10,020
okay Kaku says too many papers too few

2003
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:11,699
glasses of dry Scotch yes I have a glass

2004
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:14,580
of tea

2005
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:16,620
try and set a good example dry Scotch

2006
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:18,960
it's been a while since I've enjoyed a

2007
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:21,600
good glass of dry Scotch maybe try it

2008
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,620
again this one time I actually got a bit

2009
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:28,080
a bit uh sick from whiskey has been a

2010
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:31,560
while to return here in Belgium I really

2011
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,260
enjoyed all of these great Belgian beers

2012
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,540
but not too many of them of course but

2013
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:38,520
my goodness that was one of the

2014
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:41,520
highlights of my year

2015
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,620
to enjoy a good Belgian beer and peace

2016
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,739
on the on the sofa

2017
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:51,420
uh with a good friend talking economics

2018
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:53,219
okay some question okay oh I have a name

2019
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,719
that's difficult for me to pronounce but

2020
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:56,580
says what's your opinion on the Dutch

2021
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,219
farmer protests so this is also

2022
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:01,199
something that I wanted to

2023
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:04,440
maybe make a video about but didn't get

2024
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,880
around to it uh the so for those few not

2025
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,159
in the know in the Netherlands there

2026
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,219
were actually quite big farmer protests

2027
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:12,659
because

2028
01:25:10,219 --> 01:25:14,100
uh well you know the Netherlands

2029
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:15,179
basically wants to get rid of some of

2030
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,580
its farmers

2031
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:20,040
which is credited to to some people

2032
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:23,280
because you were having this food crisis

2033
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:25,260
to do throughout the year

2034
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,600
and so many people were also saying like

2035
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:29,640
a uh uh this crazy in the food crisis

2036
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,739
but let's put a bit of nuance here this

2037
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:37,560
was all about not CO2 but uh uh stick

2038
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:38,940
stuff uh which is uh with you for which

2039
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,980
I forgot the English name at the moment

2040
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:45,300
so maybe someone is in the chat will

2041
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:48,360
have you out nitrogen anyway which is

2042
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:50,580
bad for nature areas and there were too

2043
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,620
many and it was all about meat and milk

2044
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:56,040
Farmers so it was about mostly about

2045
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:59,159
animals so the argument there I I didn't

2046
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:01,500
find so strong like uh we need food no

2047
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:05,219
we basically mostly need plant-based

2048
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:08,340
food in a food crisis uh sorry so that

2049
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:10,739
that was not a big argument but uh one

2050
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:13,260
part about this which I think is

2051
01:26:10,739 --> 01:26:16,560
underappreciated is that

2052
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,719
the Dutch government uh you know didn't

2053
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:23,040
communicate about this properly they

2054
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:27,120
were forced to to do this uh in court by

2055
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:30,120
environmental activists uh who and you

2056
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,920
know for understandable reasons but then

2057
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,480
a lot of these Farmers built like

2058
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,000
farming is a hard business and you

2059
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:40,620
invest a ton of money it's very slim

2060
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,840
margins and uh you you you you then from

2061
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:44,639
in a poorly proper in a poorly

2062
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,620
communicated way get told like hey

2063
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:50,400
you've invested for all these years uh

2064
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:52,320
in your business uh and you you're not

2065
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,719
you don't have so much income even

2066
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,520
though a farmer is wealthy they often

2067
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,639
have a lot of debt it's not not like

2068
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,440
they have access to that wealth per se

2069
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:04,320
immediately and it's a way of life and

2070
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:06,179
now uh yeah it's uh you have to stop so

2071
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,520
I I can understand why they were very

2072
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:11,159
angry let's put it like that

2073
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,780
for for a more informed opinion I would

2074
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,580
have to do a full video I would have to

2075
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:16,260
do more research because I don't these

2076
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:20,880
are very touchy subjects

2077
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:21,780
I want to do them Justice

2078
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,139
um

2079
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:27,179
yeah um so I'm not completely I don't

2080
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:28,679
have a full opinion on it but I can

2081
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,199
understand at least why they were angry

2082
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:32,880
I think the communication there and the

2083
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:34,500
planning was really bad by the Dutch

2084
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,260
government

2085
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,780
um of course some of these protests also

2086
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,179
got out of hand and

2087
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:43,380
were not always conducted in a classy

2088
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:45,120
manner

2089
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:48,179
trying to stay a little bit diplomatic

2090
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:50,760
to avoid any

2091
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:52,739
yeah no I just shouldn't uh shouldn't

2092
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,239
have a super strong I typically try to

2093
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:56,639
not have a super strong opinion on stuff

2094
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:57,840
that I didn't research too well

2095
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,060
okay

2096
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,139
um yeah so this is what kakusa's farmers

2097
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,159
are wealth in essence very poor

2098
01:28:01,139 --> 01:28:03,840
financially

2099
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:06,860
um in income right

2100
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,560
uh okay any more questions

2101
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,560
[Music]

2102
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,560
um

2103
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,080
I would look for China for next year

2104
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,540
um

2105
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,179
it depends on the government action so

2106
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:24,659
it really depends on what they will do

2107
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:27,000
um how much stimulus they will give

2108
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:29,340
so far they've given the impression that

2109
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,420
they don't want to completely re-inflate

2110
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,480
the bubble and they've given the

2111
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:36,600
impression that they cannot

2112
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:38,219
do the structural reforms needed

2113
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,960
structure reforms a very vague term

2114
01:28:38,219 --> 01:28:42,000
often used in economics to mean all

2115
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,860
sorts of sometimes very controversial

2116
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,920
things but what I mean here is that they

2117
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:49,020
have this economy that's built to build

2118
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,520
build to build build to build all of

2119
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:54,659
these huge Flats

2120
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:58,620
roads trains houses that was very useful

2121
01:28:54,659 --> 01:29:00,840
at the start not so useful anymore

2122
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:03,960
um and it's and and then it's very much

2123
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,699
export based so investment based and

2124
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,219
expert based is what economists call

2125
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:10,500
that typically

2126
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:12,719
Chinese leaders know this they want to

2127
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,699
shift towards more consumption based

2128
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,440
economy

2129
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:21,000
more also more high high tech more

2130
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:24,780
service but so far it seems like they

2131
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,580
don't have the the will to actually do

2132
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:28,260
measures that

2133
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:30,600
really do that so they say they're going

2134
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:33,239
to do it but so far they haven't really

2135
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,460
done that and they always reverse back

2136
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:38,219
to re-inflating the property bubble

2137
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:41,400
further so my Outlook and then they have

2138
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:42,960
this huge demographic issue that

2139
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,120
um yeah as a result of the one child

2140
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,739
policy that there are many you know the

2141
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,719
population is seemingly shrinking

2142
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:52,080
there's I've also read some indications

2143
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:53,880
that the population statistics are not

2144
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:57,239
fully reliable so that maybe already

2145
01:29:53,880 --> 01:30:00,540
shrinking uh so I still think the Japan

2146
01:29:57,239 --> 01:30:03,780
scenario is the most likely

2147
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:06,380
big stagnation and um

2148
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:08,820
at a lower level uh than Japan

2149
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:11,280
which is important for the people in

2150
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,420
China which is not good news

2151
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,219
um

2152
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,400
but

2153
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:19,739
um yeah maybe they know that this is a

2154
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,020
problem so maybe they will do the right

2155
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:24,360
policies but then they also seemingly

2156
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,580
are getting more authoritarian

2157
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:29,520
and then you know as we've now seen in

2158
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:31,980
Russia that you know slowly if you

2159
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:34,199
surround yourself with only people that

2160
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:36,719
tell you what you want to hear maybe not

2161
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:39,179
great for Governors governance and their

2162
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,179
right policies in the long run

2163
01:30:39,179 --> 01:30:46,139
the macroeconomy is super tricky huge

2164
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:49,020
huge system uh very difficult to run

2165
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:51,600
properly on your own as a strong person

2166
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,480
strong man is what they would say

2167
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:57,060
so I'm not super optimistic I think it

2168
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,940
will stagnate further maybe have

2169
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,360
maybe even decline a little bit

2170
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:04,739
all right

2171
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:07,500
sorry if I Butch the pronunciation again

2172
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:10,260
is in this decade for growth uh yeah

2173
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:12,239
I've seen quite positive uh you know

2174
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,139
numbers are positive more and more

2175
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:15,199
positive

2176
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:15,199
um

2177
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:20,219
uh articles from people that I follow

2178
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:22,620
but uh I need to do more research on

2179
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:24,840
this I don't know yet

2180
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:27,179
enough about the Indian economy really

2181
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:30,560
should uh should do a deep dive

2182
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:30,560
cautiously optimistic

2183
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:36,860
um okay let's see um

2184
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:44,580
it's a question obviously by Michael so

2185
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,020
is there more money created by Banks the

2186
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,820
money printed by central banks how much

2187
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:49,560
impact do you think money printing has

2188
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:52,159
on inflation compared to overall money

2189
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,159
creation

2190
01:31:52,199 --> 01:31:57,300
uh yeah so that that's really tricky

2191
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,860
question because money printing I it's

2192
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,960
all it's not not always clear what

2193
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:03,719
people mean by it how I interpret that

2194
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,360
is create money

2195
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:08,520
by Central Bank or

2196
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,080
maybe even if maybe even if private

2197
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,400
Banks created but the government is it

2198
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,980
comes from the government

2199
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,780
and it has to end up in the hands of the

2200
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:17,580
people is I what I would say is money

2201
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:20,100
predict because they have to do it to

2202
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:22,440
pay their bills and then it would be

2203
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,639
inflationary if it's not used to grow

2204
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:27,659
the economy

2205
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:29,760
that that makes sense right so uh that

2206
01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:30,719
happens from time to time it happened in

2207
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,940
Sri Lanka and some of these

2208
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,980
hyperinflation countries it happens

2209
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:36,659
uh during covert pandemic it actually

2210
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:38,460
happened a little bit in advanced

2211
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:41,219
economies as well

2212
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:43,860
arguably even the the huge fiscal

2213
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:45,300
spending uh during covert pandemic was I

2214
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,980
would say that is money printing is

2215
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:48,840
closest to money printing much more

2216
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:49,560
money printing than quantitative easing

2217
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,840
is

2218
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,400
because you know even if they don't do

2219
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,320
it through the

2220
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:58,020
Central Bank they do it through Banks

2221
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:00,000
Banks create money to facilitate to to

2222
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:01,620
lend to the government

2223
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,060
that's very close to money printing

2224
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:05,639
right

2225
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:07,980
um how inflationary will it be well it

2226
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:11,300
depends I think if you're in inside a

2227
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:13,620
lockdown situation where you're

2228
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:15,900
capacity to make stuff is severely

2229
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:18,000
constrained yeah it makes sense that it

2230
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:21,060
contributes to inflation

2231
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,520
if you do it in a way that grows the

2232
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,139
economy it's not inflationary but that's

2233
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,719
very difficult and maybe it takes time

2234
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:31,260
so I can understand it's on average

2235
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:34,980
inflationary so yes proper money

2236
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:37,020
printing I would yeah it's necessary to

2237
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:39,060
grow an economy sometimes

2238
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,380
it is still probably slightly

2239
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:43,560
inflationary

2240
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:45,719
but it's very rare in advanced economies

2241
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,820
rarely sort of what

2242
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:50,280
people like Ray dalio talk about in this

2243
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:51,360
very simple terms money printing oh they

2244
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,460
just

2245
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,719
uh oh they're going to print money and

2246
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,540
then they're going to devalue their

2247
01:33:54,719 --> 01:34:00,239
currency how they used to do it in uh in

2248
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:03,600
in the 17th century we just don't live

2249
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:05,880
in an economy anymore because most

2250
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:09,480
money that central banks create is only

2251
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:12,480
used as interbank money between Banks

2252
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:15,960
so you need the private sector then to

2253
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:18,719
follow and it doesn't always happen

2254
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,219
okay Daniel coxeel says here any

2255
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,020
thoughts on demographic change happening

2256
01:34:20,219 --> 01:34:24,179
around the world a lot of baby boomers

2257
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:25,620
approaching uh retirement age especially

2258
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:27,780
in Europe which will affect the economy

2259
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:31,139
yes I think you already saw this in the

2260
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:32,760
US uh there the unemployment rate is uh

2261
01:34:31,139 --> 01:34:37,260
fairly low

2262
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:39,120
and it's shot but more interestingly the

2263
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:41,280
labor participation rate so how many

2264
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,580
people of your population are in the

2265
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:47,880
labor force really dropped uh and what I

2266
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:49,800
read about this mostly is that a lot of

2267
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,540
these baby boomer Generations or a big

2268
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,060
generational wave

2269
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:57,300
I thought you know what yeah with this

2270
01:34:54,060 --> 01:35:00,000
covert wave I'm just gonna quit early

2271
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,280
and so

2272
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,040
there's a theory by professor goodheart

2273
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:07,800
and an Indian Economist whose name I

2274
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,730
just forgot what

2275
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,900
I mentioned in my inflation video

2276
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,400
[Music]

2277
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,199
um

2278
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,940
their theory is that this will be

2279
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:17,719
inflationary because you have this

2280
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:21,179
production in labor force

2281
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:23,100
and this aging generation is going to

2282
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:25,800
spend spend there this just the money

2283
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:27,480
they saved so that if that's true

2284
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,340
it should

2285
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,900
um

2286
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:34,920
see like pressure on asset price to go

2287
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:37,080
down further and inflationary pressure

2288
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:39,239
um and that but that might also be good

2289
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:41,639
for low that we have lower unemployment

2290
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:43,380
for longer now if that is true

2291
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:45,960
I think it's uh it's a convincing

2292
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:47,580
hypothesis we haven't seen it in Japan

2293
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,280
yet but

2294
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:53,880
they maybe outsourced a lot of of that

2295
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:57,000
work is what these professors are saying

2296
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:59,699
yeah uh it's a convincing hypothesis but

2297
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,260
let's uh I'll need to dive more into the

2298
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:02,580
demographic stuff a little bit to be to

2299
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,980
be honest it's not my specialty

2300
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:08,100
Financial economics more where I came

2301
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:09,719
from uh but uh you know I always do most

2302
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,620
of my research for for all of these

2303
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:12,739
videos

2304
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,739
um

2305
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,920
okay Gary says do you think AI can help

2306
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:21,000
the global economy you know I started

2307
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:23,280
using this chatbot uh chat GPT to help

2308
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,540
me sort of rewrite uh one or two

2309
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,320
paragraphs

2310
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:30,360
I was mildly impressed uh the the the

2311
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,960
writing was good

2312
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:36,960
but but uh it clearly didn't know what

2313
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:39,179
it was talking about very well so it was

2314
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:42,239
only mildly useful but that being said

2315
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:46,139
I've seen some of these AIS do

2316
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:48,360
animations and so it I think it

2317
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:50,760
definitely contributes to this process

2318
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,980
of what Economist schumpeter calls

2319
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:55,800
creative destruction

2320
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:58,080
which is all about sort of the economy

2321
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,540
sort of getting rid of the old

2322
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,920
Industries and building new ones and

2323
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,540
then thereby growing the economy because

2324
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,639
as a whole you become more productive

2325
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:08,400
and so as a whole you have more stuff

2326
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:11,400
right and this is also why I would say

2327
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,199
GDP could potentially grow even if we

2328
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,420
have finite resources

2329
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,580
and the AI Revolution is uh is is

2330
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:21,000
definitely one of the coolest things

2331
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:22,620
I've seen so far unexpected because I

2332
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,239
thought after

2333
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:29,639
of the deep learning stuff uh with uh

2334
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:32,940
them defeating go and doing really cool

2335
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:34,739
stuff in games like Starcraft uh but

2336
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:37,440
then I saw it like

2337
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:39,900
stole out a little bit but now to see it

2338
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:42,239
continuing this this innovative

2339
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:44,460
uh I can definitely see it contributing

2340
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:47,420
to economic growth for sure yeah very uh

2341
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,420
cool development

2342
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,120
um all right

2343
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:59,159
what are Mark what are your thoughts on

2344
01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:00,420
the depth to GTP ratio uh it's still

2345
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:04,260
high

2346
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:08,520
but especially in country like China but

2347
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:10,860
maybe if inflation ends up maybe coming

2348
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:12,840
down but not going back to deflation so

2349
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:15,360
we have permanently higher prices

2350
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,580
because Energy prices and food were

2351
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:20,580
maybe the ones that contributed most

2352
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:22,380
this year but wages I don't believe in

2353
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:24,060
this wage price spiral that it should

2354
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:26,880
spiral out of control but wages are

2355
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:29,340
likely going to catch up and that would

2356
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,380
contribute to inflation for longer and

2357
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:34,020
also you can see it now already here in

2358
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:35,699
coffee shops that you know they're

2359
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,199
charging higher prices because of higher

2360
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:39,600
entity prices which makes total sense

2361
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:40,920
because it's a huge input cost so it

2362
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,480
makes sense that inflation is going to

2363
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,480
be broader

2364
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:49,440
now that would contribute to more

2365
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:53,280
inflation next year but would mean that

2366
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:55,440
the debt to that is more manageable

2367
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,760
so the adapt to normal GDP ratio of

2368
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,440
course wouldn't really matter but adapt

2369
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,739
to real GDP ratio

2370
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:04,100
would go down uh because of this that

2371
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:04,100
could be

2372
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:10,020
so okay uh Gaspard says can you make a

2373
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:11,880
video looking at economic and macro

2374
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:14,000
impacts of strikes

2375
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,000
um

2376
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:17,040
so I do have to take into account a

2377
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:19,380
little bit also what people are looking

2378
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,300
for and I haven't seen too many demand

2379
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:24,179
for that but like that

2380
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:26,520
but what I try to do now often is if

2381
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:29,639
there is an economic case or

2382
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:31,560
I try to put some theory in in that con

2383
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:32,760
like country analysis for example so

2384
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,380
maybe

2385
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,840
if something happened where we see a lot

2386
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:38,400
of strikes I can put I can tie it into

2387
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,760
that because it is an interesting

2388
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,760
subject

2389
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:46,800
all right

2390
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:48,120
um okay so shung says uh if I pronounce

2391
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,600
correctly how should most people store

2392
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:54,239
money during a recession uh

2393
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:57,120
ooh crypto getting kidding uh have a

2394
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:58,440
look at some um I think plain bagel made

2395
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:01,800
a video about this he's a professional

2396
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:04,260
investor that's honest in my opinion

2397
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:07,380
check that out that's a better Source

2398
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:10,380
than me at the moment for this

2399
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:12,900
all right so uh I I don't see so many

2400
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:15,780
questions uh coming anymore and I think

2401
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:17,699
this has been a good review session

2402
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:20,460
and with that being said thank you so

01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:23,400

being patrons or members really helps me

2409
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:41,219
out a lot my plan for next year is to

2410
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:44,280
try and release my my goal would be two

2411
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:46,380
videos per month uh but it's very tricky

2412
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,699
for me and then one live stream that's

2413
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:51,060
what I hope

2414
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:52,980
but uh around March

2415
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:55,139
uh that's really nice I likely am going

2416
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:56,940
to be a father so it could be that

2417
01:40:55,139 --> 01:40:59,280
you're gonna be missing me for a month

2418
01:40:56,940 --> 01:41:01,739
or something or maybe longer depending

2419
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:04,679
on how it goes so I'm really looking

2420
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:05,960
forward to 2023 for that reason but I'm

2421
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:08,580
going to try to

2422
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:13,280
become more consistent this is my goal

2423
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:15,900
two videos per month and one interview

2424
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:18,300
and then I've been working on a course

2425
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:19,520
monetary economics I want to make this

2426
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,739
subject

2427
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:26,760
more approachable so in the money micro

2428
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:29,219
style with nice examples and as little

2429
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,199
jargon as possible and that should come

2430
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:33,239
out next year I've been working with two

2431
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:35,940

2432
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:38,340
